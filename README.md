# Agentic Visual Reporting <img src="/docs/public/assets/vis-logo-light.svg" align="right" alt="IEEE VIS 25 Logo" width="256"/>

> A composable agentic system for automated visual data reporting, implementing a Human-AI Partnership model for transparent and steerable data analysis.

## Overview

This prototype system demonstrates a multi-agent architecture that strategically externalizes logic from LLMs to deterministic modules, leveraging [Draco](https://github.com/cmudig/draco2) for principled visualization design. The system delivers dual outputs:

- **Interactive [Observable](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit) reports** with [Mosaic](https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic) for reader exploration
- **Executable [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebooks** for deep, analyst-facing traceability

For complete details, see our [whitepaper](docs/public/assets/paper.pdf).

## Architecture

![System Architecture](docs/public/assets/teaser.svg)

The system consists of 11 specialized agents orchestrated in a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Data Understanding**: Field Refiner → Dataset Describer → Field Expander → Dataset Profiler
2. **Analysis**: Insight Planner → Dataset Deriver → Dataset Publisher
3. **Visualization**: Dataset Visualizer (powered by Draco)
4. **Reporting**: Report Narrator → Dataset Reporter
