# Report Gallery

Explore visual data reports generated by our agentic system. For each entry, the system processed datasets as providedâ€”handling preparation, analysis, and visualization autonomously. The examples span a variety of domains and data types, illustrating a general, dataset-agnostic approach without manual intervention or hardâ€‘coded configurations.

## Before You Dive In

**ðŸ’¡ Why Our Reports Are Intentionally Concise**

The focused length of these reports reflects a **conscious design philosophy** rooted in our Human-AI Partnership model [as outlined in our paper](../paper). Rather than attempting to **exhaustively anticipate user needs**â€”which often leads to extensive analysis based on potentially incorrect assumptionsâ€”our system produces a **curated starting point** that serves two complementary purposes.

**For Analysts:** The report provides a **solid foundation for iterative refinement**. Human intent is often ambiguous at the outset and evolves as insights emerge. A minor misalignment can render an agent's entire output useless, forcing costly regeneration that erodes user trust and agency. By delivering focused, high-quality insights with **full traceability**, analysts can efficiently build upon and refine the analysis rather than starting from scratch.

**For Readers:** Each report enables **open-ended exploration** beyond the AI's authored narrative. Using **interactive data tables** linked to visualizations, readers can dynamically filter and cross-reference data to answer ad-hoc questions that arise during their engagement with the contentâ€”questions the AI could never have anticipated.

This approach embodies our core belief: successful human-AI partnership stems not from demanding perfection from the AI, but from ensuring its outputs are both **deeply auditable & adaptable** for experts and **flexibly explorable** for end-users. Ultimately, we believe the **steerability and auditability of the process** that generates these reports is more valuable than any individual report instanceâ€”enabling not only systematic improvement and adaptation across diverse analytical contexts, but also the **trustability** that comes from transparent, traceable decision-making of the AI. The result is a more **sustainable, collaborative workflow** that prioritizes **human agency** alongside automation.

## Challenge Dataset Reports

### IEEE VIS Publication Analysis

Our challenge entry uses the [VIS publications dataset](https://vispubdata.org/data-details), processed with the standard agentic pipelineâ€”no special rules or tuning.
