# Principles

Our system aims to address fundamental challenges in AI-powered data analysis through four core design principles. Each feature tackles a specific limitation of traditional approaches, creating a more transparent, sustainable, and collaborative analytical experience.

Traditional AI analytics systems suffer from opacity, fragility, and inflexibility. They generate monolithic outputs that are difficult to understand, impossible to sustainably refine, and quickly become obsolete. We strived to create a system that fundamentally reimagines this paradigm.

**🧩 [Composability & Modularity](./composability-and-modularity)** moves critical logic out of opaque language models into specialized, deterministic components. Statistical profiling and rule-based visualization design create reliable, auditable foundations that improve over time.

**🔍 [Explainability & Trust](./explainability-and-trust)** provides complete provenance for every insight through interactive notebooks. Users can trace data transformations, validate reasoning, and understand how conclusions were reached—transforming AI from a black box into a transparent analytical partner.

**🧭 [Interactive Exploration](./interactive-exploration)** transforms static reports into dynamic environments. Readers can explore beyond the initial narrative through cross-filtering and real-time interactions, discovering insights that even sophisticated AI systems cannot anticipate.

**🎯 [Granularity & Agency](./granularity-and-agency)** enables surgical modifications without regenerating entire reports. Built on open standards, our modular outputs give analysts true agency to evolve their work sustainably, creating living documents that improve over time.

Together, we hope these features chart a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration in data analysis—one that prioritizes transparency, sustainability, and genuine partnership over automation alone.
