I need to ensure a good balance of insight types (Temporal, Correlation, Ranking, Distribution) and diverse field usage, especially for primary numeric/temporal fields. I will also prioritize segmentation and creating derived categorical fields.\n\nHere's my initial plan sketch:\n\n1.  **Insight 1 (Temporal/Trend):** Analyze how `Miles_per_Gallon` has changed over `Year`, segmented by `Origin`. This will show fuel efficiency trends across different manufacturing regions.\n    *   Primary fields: `Miles_per_Gallon`, `Year`\n    *   Segmentation: `Origin`\n    *   Type: Summary (average MPG per year)\n\n2.  **Insight 2 (Correlation/Value):** Explore the relationship between `Horsepower` and `Weight_in_lbs`, colored by a derived `Cylinders_Tier` (e.g., low, medium, high) and faceted by `Origin`. This will show how engine power relates to vehicle weight, considering cylinder count and origin.\n    *   Primary fields: `Horsepower`, `Weight_in_lbs`\n    *   Segmentation: `Cylinders_Tier` (derived from `Cylinders`), `Origin`\n    *   Type: Value (individual vehicle points)\n\n3.  **Insight 3 (Ranking/Summary):** Rank `Origin` by average `Acceleration`, and then further segment by a derived `Weight_Category` (e.g., light, medium, heavy). This will highlight which regions produce vehicles with better acceleration, considering their weight class.\n    *   Primary fields: `Acceleration`\n    *   Segmentation: `Origin`, `Weight_Category` (derived from `Weight_in_lbs`)\n    *   Type: Summary (average acceleration)\n\n4.  **Insight 4 (Distribution/Summary):** Examine the distribution of `Displacement` across different `Cylinders` counts, segmented by `Origin`. This will show typical engine sizes for different cylinder configurations and origins.\n    *   Primary fields: `Displacement`\n    *   Segmentation: `Cylinders`, `Origin`\n    *   Type: Summary (median displacement)\n\nI will now use `get_insight_plan_hints` to validate my choices, especially for correlations and suitable segmenters.

I have:\n*   **Insight 1 (Temporal/Trend):** `Miles_per_Gallon` over `Year`, segmented by `Origin`. (Uses `Miles_per_Gallon`, `Year`)\n*   **Insight 2 (Correlation/Value):** `Horsepower` vs `Weight_in_lbs`, segmented by derived `Cylinders_Tier` and `Origin`. (Uses `Horsepower`, `Weight_in_lbs`)\n*   **Insight 3 (Ranking/Summary):** Rank `Origin` by `Acceleration`, segmented by derived `Weight_Category`. (Uses `Acceleration`)\n*   **Insight 4 (Distribution/Summary):** Distribution of `Displacement` by `Cylinders`, segmented by `Origin`. (Uses `Displacement`, `Cylinders`)\n\nField usage check:\n*   `Miles_per_Gallon`: Used once (Insight 1)\n*   `Year`: Used once (Insight 1)\n*   `Horsepower`: Used once (Insight 2)\n*   `Weight_in_lbs`: Used once (Insight 2), derived for Insight 3\n*   `Acceleration`: Used once (Insight 3)\n*   `Displacement`: Used once (Insight 4)\n*   `Cylinders`: Used once (Insight 4), derived for Insight 2\n*   `Origin`: Used in all insights for segmentation. This is good as it's a categorical field.\n*   `Name`: Not used, which is fine as it's a high-cardinality identifier.\n\nAll primary numeric/temporal fields are used at most once, except for `Cylinders` and `Weight_in_lbs` which are used once directly and once for deriving a categorical field, which is acceptable. I've covered 7 out of 8 numeric/temporal fields (`Miles_per_Gallon`, `Cylinders`, `Displacement`, `Horsepower`, `Weight_in_lbs`, `Acceleration`, `Year`). This meets the 80%+ coverage target.\n\nI have a good mix of insight types: 1 Temporal, 1 Correlation (Value), 1 Ranking (Summary), 1 Distribution (Summary).

MUST adhere to:\n- **Scalar outputs only** (TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, TIMESTAMP); UNNEST arrays or extract from STRUCT if needed.\n- **MANDATORY YEAR TO DATE CONVERSION**: Any field representing a Year (named 'Year', 'year', or containing year values like 2020, 2021, etc.) MUST be converted to DATE type using `MAKE_DATE(\"Year\", 1, 1)`. Never return year fields as integers or strings.\n- **No rank columns**; use ORDER BY + LIMIT for implicit rankings.\n- Maximum 5 columns for analytical fields ('primary', 'segment', 'facet'), plus unlimited 'detail' fields (IDs, context).\n- **NULL handling in aggregations**: CRITICAL - treat NULLs as missing data, not zeros. Use FILTER clauses or WHERE conditions to exclude NULLs from aggregations: `AVG(col) FILTER (WHERE col IS NOT NULL)` or subquery filtering.\n- **Column ordering**: Use intuitive, natural ordering for table viewing - typically: (1) human-readable identifiers/names first, (2) PRIMARY KEY fields second, (3) primary analysis fields, (4) secondary dimensions, (5) measures/quantitative fields, (6) status/categorical fields. This creates a logical flow for end users scanning table data.\n- **PRIMARY KEY preservation**: When including PRIMARY KEY fields, always preserve the original field name exactly as-is (only convert to snake_case if needed), never add prefixes like 'id_' or suffixes like '_key'. For example, 'ProductID' becomes 'product_id', not 'id_product' or 'product_id_key'.\n- Transform booleans/codes with CASE, e.g., CASE WHEN is_active THEN 'Active' ELSE 'Inactive' END.\n- Clean strings: use TRIM(); use LOWER() only in comparisons (WHERE/ON), never in SELECT outputs.\n- **Respect proper noun casing**: NEVER output personal/organization/place/product names in lowercase. Preserve source casing in outputs; if normalization is needed, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) while avoiding changes to known acronyms.\n- Handle nulls: COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(col), ''), 'Unknown') for strings, COALESCE(col, 0) for numbers.\n- Use $tablename as table placeholder.\n- Use snake_case ASCII aliases ([a-z0-9_]+ only). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n- Quote column names with spaces, e.g., 'Column Name'.\n- Include comments for complex logic or transformations.\n- For long format, use UNPIVOT or UNION ALL to transform multiple measures into a single measure column with a type column.\n- Include identifier and context columns as 'detail' fields (unlimited), balancing analytical value with interactive utility.\n- **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data, include it as a 'detail' field with alias 'url'. Only derive URLs when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid (e.g., combining base_url + path, 'https://api.domain.com/items/' + id, 'https://github.com/' + username), (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value for linking to external resources, profiles, or documentation, and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Use string concatenation or CONCAT() function. Skip if uncertain about URL validity or no clear opportunity exists.\n- **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries returning individual records (no GROUP BY/aggregation), include related contextual fields as 'detail' role, even if not explicitly requested: prioritize LOW-CARDINALITY categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department) and TEMPORAL fields (created_date, modified_date, month, day_of_week) from the original dataset. These enhance interactive exploration, cross-filtering, and tooltips without counting toward the 5-column analytical limit. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries, do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this breaks aggregation logic.\n- **ULTRA-SHORT LABELS**: Use the shortest possible human-readable labels (1–2 words preferred) for projected columns to optimize axis/legend readability.\n2. `provenance` (ViewProvenance): COMPLETE provenance metadata documenting the lineage of every field in the generated view.\nFor each field in the 'fields' list, the 'description' MUST be factually accurate and reference the exact source field ID(s) from the original dataset.\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [source_field_id] used without modification'.\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [source_field_id]: [exact_computation_performed]'.\nExamples: 'Original field customer_name used without modification', 'Derived from sales_amount: Sum aggregated by product_category',\n'Derived from customer_name: Direct selection with TRIM() applied', 'Derived from order_date: Extracted year component using EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)'.\nThis documentation ensures full accountability and traceability for derived data.\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## table_summary ## ]]\n{table_summary}\n\n[[ ## analytical_goal ## ]]\n{analytical_goal}\n\n[[ ## sql ## ]]\n{sql}\n\n[[ ## provenance ## ]]\n{provenance}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {\"type\": \"object\", \"$defs\": {\"GeneratedField\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"description\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"FACTUAL and ACCOUNTABLE lineage description that provides complete derivation transparency.\\nMust explicitly reference the original source field ID(s) from the dataset and describe the exact computational steps taken.\\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [original_field_name] used without modification'.\\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [original_field_name]: [exact computation/transformation performed]'.\\nFor aggregated fields, specify the aggregation function and grouping.\\nFor transformed fields, detail the transformation logic.\\nUsers must be able to trace back to the source data and understand exactly what they are looking at.\\nAvoid vague terms - be precise about operations, filters, and calculations applied.\", \"title\": \"Description\"}, \"label\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Human-friendly, whitespace separated label of this field, as it should appear in visualizations.\\nPrefer a single-word label whenever possible; otherwise choose the shortest phrasing that remains clear and descriptive.\\nAXIS READABILITY: Keep labels AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE (ideally 1–2 words) so they fit on axes and legends without truncation.\\nLabels will be quoted verbatim in downstream report text, so they must read naturally and flow with surrounding prose.\\nSTRICT LABELING: Use only standard English ASCII characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9 and spaces).

NEVER return year fields as integers or strings - always convert to proper DATE format using MAKE_DATE().\n        8. Preserve temporal types: columns with `Date`, `DateTime`, `Timestamp` semantics must remain as DuckDB temporal types, never strings or numbers.\n        8. Reduce field cardinality for visualization efficiency (e.g., bin continuous values, group rare categories).\n        9. Prefer long format over wide format to simplify downstream visualization: pivot multiple measure columns into a single measure column with a categorical column for type. For example, instead of columns `avg_type_a`, `avg_type_b`, transform into `measure_value` (quantitative) and `measure_type` (categorical, e.g., 'Type A', 'Type B') using UNPIVOT or UNION ALL.\n        10. Include unique identifier column whenever possible. When returning non-aggregated values and a PRIMARY KEY field is present in the source data, it MUST be included in the output. Additionally, include human-readable identifier columns (e.g., name, title, label fields) that provide meaningful context for data points.\n        11. In addition to the unique ID, include a name-like or human-readable identifier column (e.g., item name, product title, or customer name) to encode as a tooltip for interactive visualizations. For example, when analyzing correlations between two quantitative variables, include a nominal column (e.g., item_name) to identify data points on hover in scatter plots or similar charts.\n        12. Include additional categorical columns as 'detail' field role for NON-AGGREGATED queries, even if the analytical goal does not explicitly request them. Detail fields do not count toward the 5-column limit, so prioritize meaningful context columns for filtering, grouping, or conditional formatting (e.g., category, type, status, region fields). For AGGREGATED queries, only include 'detail' fields that are part of the GROUP BY clause or explicitly requested.\n        13. Prefer to return as many data points as possible for insightful downstream vis, e.g. if goal is to identify distribution, the more data point there is for visualization, the better.\n        14. **CRITICAL NULL HANDLING IN AGGREGATIONS**: When performing aggregations (AVG, MEAN, SUM, etc.), treat NULL values as missing data, NOT as zeros. Filter NULL values BEFORE aggregation to ensure semantic accuracy. Use WHERE clauses or FILTER expressions to exclude NULLs from calculations. For example: `AVG(column_name) FILTER (WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL)` or `WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL` in subqueries. This ensures aggregations reflect true data patterns rather than artificially inflated denominators or skewed results from implicit zero-substitution.\n        15. **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries that return individual records without aggregation, include additional related fields as 'detail' role fields, even if not explicitly requested. Prioritize categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department, etc.), temporal fields (created_date, modified_date, etc.), and descriptive fields (description, notes, tags, etc.) that enhance interactive exploration in cross-filter-enabled environments. These fields enable rich filtering, tooltips, conditional formatting, and ad-hoc analysis. 'Detail' fields don't count toward the 5-column analytical limit, so be generous with contextual information. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries (GROUP BY, aggregate functions), do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this would break the aggregation logic and produce incorrect results.\n        16. **RESPECT PROPER NOUN CASING**: NEVER output personal names, organization names, place names, product names, or titles in lowercase. Preserve original casing in SELECT outputs. Use LOWER() only for comparisons (e.g., in WHERE/ON), never for final projected columns. When normalization is required for outputs, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) and avoid altering known acronyms.\n        17. **STRICT ASCII ALIASES**: All SQL column aliases must be ASCII-only snake_case using only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores ([a-z0-9_]+). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n        18. **STRICT ASCII LABELS**: Field labels used downstream must contain only standard English ASCII characters (letters, digits, spaces). No diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols; avoid punctuation unless essential.\n        19. **ULTRA-SHORT FIELD LABELS**: Choose the SHORTEST possible human-readable labels (ideally 1–2 words) to ensure axis/legend readability and avoid truncation in downstream visualizations.\n        20. **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data (e.g., combining base URLs with paths, constructing API endpoints, building profile links from usernames, creating documentation links from identifiers), include it as a 'detail' field named 'url'. Only add URL fields when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid and functional, (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value (e.g., linking to profiles, documentation, external resources), and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Skip URL derivation if uncertain about validity or if no clear opportunity exists. Examples: website_base + '/' + username → url, 'https://api.example.com/items/' + item_id → url, 'https://github.com/' + github_username → url.\n        \n        **DuckDB API Refresher**:\n        - Computing list lengths: `SELECT len(my_list_column) AS list_length FROM my_table;`\n        - Proper casing: `SELECT INITCAP(name_column) AS name_column FROM $tablename;` (use only when the source text is incorrectly cased; do not change known acronyms)"},{"role":"user","content":"[[ ## table_summary ## ]]\n# Table: Vehicle Performance and Specifications\n\n> This dataset explores the performance characteristics of various vehicles, focusing on fuel efficiency, engine specifications, and physical attributes.

Never return year fields as integers or strings.\n- **No rank columns**; use ORDER BY + LIMIT for implicit rankings.\n- Maximum 5 columns for analytical fields ('primary', 'segment', 'facet'), plus unlimited 'detail' fields (IDs, context).\n- **NULL handling in aggregations**: CRITICAL - treat NULLs as missing data, not zeros. Use FILTER clauses or WHERE conditions to exclude NULLs from aggregations: `AVG(col) FILTER (WHERE col IS NOT NULL)` or subquery filtering.\n- **Column ordering**: Use intuitive, natural ordering for table viewing - typically: (1) human-readable identifiers/names first, (2) PRIMARY KEY fields second, (3) primary analysis fields, (4) secondary dimensions, (5) measures/quantitative fields, (6) status/categorical fields. This creates a logical flow for end users scanning table data.\n- **PRIMARY KEY preservation**: When including PRIMARY KEY fields, always preserve the original field name exactly as-is (only convert to snake_case if needed), never add prefixes like 'id_' or suffixes like '_key'. For example, 'ProductID' becomes 'product_id', not 'id_product' or 'product_id_key'.\n- Transform booleans/codes with CASE, e.g., CASE WHEN is_active THEN 'Active' ELSE 'Inactive' END.\n- Clean strings: use TRIM(); use LOWER() only in comparisons (WHERE/ON), never in SELECT outputs.\n- **Respect proper noun casing**: NEVER output personal/organization/place/product names in lowercase.

No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n- Quote column names with spaces, e.g., 'Column Name'.\n- Include comments for complex logic or transformations.\n- For long format, use UNPIVOT or UNION ALL to transform multiple measures into a single measure column with a type column.\n- Include identifier and context columns as 'detail' fields (unlimited), balancing analytical value with interactive utility.\n- **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data, include it as a 'detail' field with alias 'url'. Only derive URLs when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid (e.g., combining base_url + path, 'https://api.domain.com/items/' + id, 'https://github.com/' + username), (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value for linking to external resources, profiles, or documentation, and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Use string concatenation or CONCAT() function. Skip if uncertain about URL validity or no clear opportunity exists.\n- **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries returning individual records (no GROUP BY/aggregation), include related contextual fields as 'detail' role, even if not explicitly requested: prioritize LOW-CARDINALITY categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department) and TEMPORAL fields (created_date, modified_date, month, day_of_week) from the original dataset. These enhance interactive exploration, cross-filtering, and tooltips without counting toward the 5-column analytical limit. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries, do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this breaks aggregation logic.\n- **ULTRA-SHORT LABELS**: Use the shortest possible human-readable labels (1–2 words preferred) for projected columns to optimize axis/legend readability.\n2. `provenance` (ViewProvenance): COMPLETE provenance metadata documenting the lineage of every field in the generated view.\nFor each field in the 'fields' list, the 'description' MUST be factually accurate and reference the exact source field ID(s) from the original dataset.\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [source_field_id] used without modification'.\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [source_field_id]: [exact_computation_performed]'.\nExamples: 'Original field customer_name used without modification', 'Derived from sales_amount: Sum aggregated by product_category',\n'Derived from customer_name: Direct selection with TRIM() applied', 'Derived from order_date: Extracted year component using EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)'.\nThis documentation ensures full accountability and traceability for derived data.\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## table_summary ## ]]\n{table_summary}\n\n[[ ## analytical_goal ## ]]\n{analytical_goal}\n\n[[ ## sql ## ]]\n{sql}\n\n[[ ## provenance ## ]]\n{provenance}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {\"type\": \"object\", \"$defs\": {\"GeneratedField\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"description\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"FACTUAL and ACCOUNTABLE lineage description that provides complete derivation transparency.\\nMust explicitly reference the original source field ID(s) from the dataset and describe the exact computational steps taken.\\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [original_field_name] used without modification'.\\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [original_field_name]: [exact computation/transformation performed]'.\\nFor aggregated fields, specify the aggregation function and grouping.\\nFor transformed fields, detail the transformation logic.\\nUsers must be able to trace back to the source data and understand exactly what they are looking at.\\nAvoid vague terms - be precise about operations, filters, and calculations applied.\", \"title\": \"Description\"}, \"label\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Human-friendly, whitespace separated label of this field, as it should appear in visualizations.\\nPrefer a single-word label whenever possible; otherwise choose the shortest phrasing that remains clear and descriptive.\\nAXIS READABILITY: Keep labels AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE (ideally 1–2 words) so they fit on axes and legends without truncation.\\nLabels will be quoted verbatim in downstream report text, so they must read naturally and flow with surrounding prose.\\nSTRICT LABELING: Use only standard English ASCII characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9 and spaces).

MUST adhere to:\n- **Scalar outputs only** (TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, TIMESTAMP); UNNEST arrays or extract from STRUCT if needed.\n- **MANDATORY YEAR TO DATE CONVERSION**: Any field representing a Year (named 'Year', 'year', or containing year values like 2020, 2021, etc.) MUST be converted to DATE type using `MAKE_DATE(\"Year\", 1, 1)`. Never return year fields as integers or strings.\n- **No rank columns**; use ORDER BY + LIMIT for implicit rankings.\n- Maximum 5 columns for analytical fields ('primary', 'segment', 'facet'), plus unlimited 'detail' fields (IDs, context).\n- **NULL handling in aggregations**: CRITICAL - treat NULLs as missing data, not zeros. Use FILTER clauses or WHERE conditions to exclude NULLs from aggregations: `AVG(col) FILTER (WHERE col IS NOT NULL)` or subquery filtering.\n- **Column ordering**: Use intuitive, natural ordering for table viewing - typically: (1) human-readable identifiers/names first, (2) PRIMARY KEY fields second, (3) primary analysis fields, (4) secondary dimensions, (5) measures/quantitative fields, (6) status/categorical fields. This creates a logical flow for end users scanning table data.\n- **PRIMARY KEY preservation**: When including PRIMARY KEY fields, always preserve the original field name exactly as-is (only convert to snake_case if needed), never add prefixes like 'id_' or suffixes like '_key'. For example, 'ProductID' becomes 'product_id', not 'id_product' or 'product_id_key'.\n- Transform booleans/codes with CASE, e.g., CASE WHEN is_active THEN 'Active' ELSE 'Inactive' END.\n- Clean strings: use TRIM(); use LOWER() only in comparisons (WHERE/ON), never in SELECT outputs.\n- **Respect proper noun casing**: NEVER output personal/organization/place/product names in lowercase. Preserve source casing in outputs; if normalization is needed, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) while avoiding changes to known acronyms.\n- Handle nulls: COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(col), ''), 'Unknown') for strings, COALESCE(col, 0) for numbers.\n- Use $tablename as table placeholder.\n- Use snake_case ASCII aliases ([a-z0-9_]+ only). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n- Quote column names with spaces, e.g., 'Column Name'.\n- Include comments for complex logic or transformations.\n- For long format, use UNPIVOT or UNION ALL to transform multiple measures into a single measure column with a type column.\n- Include identifier and context columns as 'detail' fields (unlimited), balancing analytical value with interactive utility.\n- **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data, include it as a 'detail' field with alias 'url'. Only derive URLs when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid (e.g., combining base_url + path, 'https://api.domain.com/items/' + id, 'https://github.com/' + username), (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value for linking to external resources, profiles, or documentation, and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Use string concatenation or CONCAT() function. Skip if uncertain about URL validity or no clear opportunity exists.\n- **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries returning individual records (no GROUP BY/aggregation), include related contextual fields as 'detail' role, even if not explicitly requested: prioritize LOW-CARDINALITY categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department) and TEMPORAL fields (created_date, modified_date, month, day_of_week) from the original dataset. These enhance interactive exploration, cross-filtering, and tooltips without counting toward the 5-column analytical limit. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries, do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this breaks aggregation logic.\n- **ULTRA-SHORT LABELS**: Use the shortest possible human-readable labels (1–2 words preferred) for projected columns to optimize axis/legend readability.\n2. `provenance` (ViewProvenance): COMPLETE provenance metadata documenting the lineage of every field in the generated view.\nFor each field in the 'fields' list, the 'description' MUST be factually accurate and reference the exact source field ID(s) from the original dataset.\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [source_field_id] used without modification'.\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [source_field_id]: [exact_computation_performed]'.\nExamples: 'Original field customer_name used without modification', 'Derived from sales_amount: Sum aggregated by product_category',\n'Derived from customer_name: Direct selection with TRIM() applied', 'Derived from order_date: Extracted year component using EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)'.\nThis documentation ensures full accountability and traceability for derived data.\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## table_summary ## ]]\n{table_summary}\n\n[[ ## analytical_goal ## ]]\n{analytical_goal}\n\n[[ ## sql ## ]]\n{sql}\n\n[[ ## provenance ## ]]\n{provenance}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {\"type\": \"object\", \"$defs\": {\"GeneratedField\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"description\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"FACTUAL and ACCOUNTABLE lineage description that provides complete derivation transparency.\\nMust explicitly reference the original source field ID(s) from the dataset and describe the exact computational steps taken.\\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [original_field_name] used without modification'.\\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [original_field_name]: [exact computation/transformation performed]'.\\nFor aggregated fields, specify the aggregation function and grouping.\\nFor transformed fields, detail the transformation logic.\\nUsers must be able to trace back to the source data and understand exactly what they are looking at.\\nAvoid vague terms - be precise about operations, filters, and calculations applied.\", \"title\": \"Description\"}, \"label\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Human-friendly, whitespace separated label of this field, as it should appear in visualizations.\\nPrefer a single-word label whenever possible; otherwise choose the shortest phrasing that remains clear and descriptive.\\nAXIS READABILITY: Keep labels AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE (ideally 1–2 words) so they fit on axes and legends without truncation.\\nLabels will be quoted verbatim in downstream report text, so they must read naturally and flow with surrounding prose.\\nSTRICT LABELING: Use only standard English ASCII characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9 and spaces).

Produces clean, scalar output optimized for charts and dashboards.\n        \n        **CRITICAL RULES:**\n        1. Output ONLY scalar columns (TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, TIMESTAMP) - NEVER LIST/ARRAY/STRUCT.\n        2. Maximum 5 columns for 'primary', 'segment', and 'facet' fields combined. 'Detail' fields (IDs, context) do not count toward this limit.\n        3. NO explicit rank columns (e.g., RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()) - use ORDER BY + LIMIT for rankings.\n        4. Transform booleans/codes into human-readable labels using CASE statements.\n        5. Handle nulls/empty strings with COALESCE and NULLIF for clean data.\n        6. Use snake_case for column aliases.\n        7. **MANDATORY YEAR TO DATE CONVERSION**: When a field represents a Year (either named \"Year\", \"year\", or similar year-like fields), it MUST be converted to a DATE type using `MAKE_DATE(\"Year\", 1, 1)`. This applies to any field that contains year values (e.g., 2020, 2021, etc.) regardless of its original data type. NEVER return year fields as integers or strings - always convert to proper DATE format using MAKE_DATE().\n        8. Preserve temporal types: columns with `Date`, `DateTime`, `Timestamp` semantics must remain as DuckDB temporal types, never strings or numbers.\n        8. Reduce field cardinality for visualization efficiency (e.g., bin continuous values, group rare categories).\n        9. Prefer long format over wide format to simplify downstream visualization: pivot multiple measure columns into a single measure column with a categorical column for type. For example, instead of columns `avg_type_a`, `avg_type_b`, transform into `measure_value` (quantitative) and `measure_type` (categorical, e.g., 'Type A', 'Type B') using UNPIVOT or UNION ALL.\n        10. Include unique identifier column whenever possible. When returning non-aggregated values and a PRIMARY KEY field is present in the source data, it MUST be included in the output. Additionally, include human-readable identifier columns (e.g., name, title, label fields) that provide meaningful context for data points.\n        11. In addition to the unique ID, include a name-like or human-readable identifier column (e.g., item name, product title, or customer name) to encode as a tooltip for interactive visualizations. For example, when analyzing correlations between two quantitative variables, include a nominal column (e.g., item_name) to identify data points on hover in scatter plots or similar charts.\n        12. Include additional categorical columns as 'detail' field role for NON-AGGREGATED queries, even if the analytical goal does not explicitly request them. Detail fields do not count toward the 5-column limit, so prioritize meaningful context columns for filtering, grouping, or conditional formatting (e.g., category, type, status, region fields). For AGGREGATED queries, only include 'detail' fields that are part of the GROUP BY clause or explicitly requested.\n        13. Prefer to return as many data points as possible for insightful downstream vis, e.g. if goal is to identify distribution, the more data point there is for visualization, the better.\n        14. **CRITICAL NULL HANDLING IN AGGREGATIONS**: When performing aggregations (AVG, MEAN, SUM, etc.), treat NULL values as missing data, NOT as zeros. Filter NULL values BEFORE aggregation to ensure semantic accuracy. Use WHERE clauses or FILTER expressions to exclude NULLs from calculations. For example: `AVG(column_name) FILTER (WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL)` or `WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL` in subqueries. This ensures aggregations reflect true data patterns rather than artificially inflated denominators or skewed results from implicit zero-substitution.\n        15. **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries that return individual records without aggregation, include additional related fields as 'detail' role fields, even if not explicitly requested. Prioritize categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department, etc.), temporal fields (created_date, modified_date, etc.), and descriptive fields (description, notes, tags, etc.) that enhance interactive exploration in cross-filter-enabled environments. These fields enable rich filtering, tooltips, conditional formatting, and ad-hoc analysis. 'Detail' fields don't count toward the 5-column analytical limit, so be generous with contextual information. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries (GROUP BY, aggregate functions), do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this would break the aggregation logic and produce incorrect results.\n        16. **RESPECT PROPER NOUN CASING**: NEVER output personal names, organization names, place names, product names, or titles in lowercase. Preserve original casing in SELECT outputs. Use LOWER() only for comparisons (e.g., in WHERE/ON), never for final projected columns. When normalization is required for outputs, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) and avoid altering known acronyms.\n        17. **STRICT ASCII ALIASES**: All SQL column aliases must be ASCII-only snake_case using only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores ([a-z0-9_]+). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n        18. **STRICT ASCII LABELS**: Field labels used downstream must contain only standard English ASCII characters (letters, digits, spaces). No diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols; avoid punctuation unless essential.\n        19. **ULTRA-SHORT FIELD LABELS**: Choose the SHORTEST possible human-readable labels (ideally 1–2 words) to ensure axis/legend readability and avoid truncation in downstream visualizations.\n        20. **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data (e.g., combining base URLs with paths, constructing API endpoints, building profile links from usernames, creating documentation links from identifiers), include it as a 'detail' field named 'url'. Only add URL fields when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid and functional, (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value (e.g., linking to profiles, documentation, external resources), and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Skip URL derivation if uncertain about validity or if no clear opportunity exists.

MUST adhere to:\n- **Scalar outputs only** (TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, TIMESTAMP); UNNEST arrays or extract from STRUCT if needed.\n- **MANDATORY YEAR TO DATE CONVERSION**: Any field representing a Year (named 'Year', 'year', or containing year values like 2020, 2021, etc.) MUST be converted to DATE type using `MAKE_DATE(\"Year\", 1, 1)`. Never return year fields as integers or strings.\n- **No rank columns**; use ORDER BY + LIMIT for implicit rankings.\n- Maximum 5 columns for analytical fields ('primary', 'segment', 'facet'), plus unlimited 'detail' fields (IDs, context).\n- **NULL handling in aggregations**: CRITICAL - treat NULLs as missing data, not zeros. Use FILTER clauses or WHERE conditions to exclude NULLs from aggregations: `AVG(col) FILTER (WHERE col IS NOT NULL)` or subquery filtering.\n- **Column ordering**: Use intuitive, natural ordering for table viewing - typically: (1) human-readable identifiers/names first, (2) PRIMARY KEY fields second, (3) primary analysis fields, (4) secondary dimensions, (5) measures/quantitative fields, (6) status/categorical fields. This creates a logical flow for end users scanning table data.\n- **PRIMARY KEY preservation**: When including PRIMARY KEY fields, always preserve the original field name exactly as-is (only convert to snake_case if needed), never add prefixes like 'id_' or suffixes like '_key'. For example, 'ProductID' becomes 'product_id', not 'id_product' or 'product_id_key'.\n- Transform booleans/codes with CASE, e.g., CASE WHEN is_active THEN 'Active' ELSE 'Inactive' END.\n- Clean strings: use TRIM(); use LOWER() only in comparisons (WHERE/ON), never in SELECT outputs.\n- **Respect proper noun casing**: NEVER output personal/organization/place/product names in lowercase. Preserve source casing in outputs; if normalization is needed, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) while avoiding changes to known acronyms.\n- Handle nulls: COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(col), ''), 'Unknown') for strings, COALESCE(col, 0) for numbers.\n- Use $tablename as table placeholder.\n- Use snake_case ASCII aliases ([a-z0-9_]+ only). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n- Quote column names with spaces, e.g., 'Column Name'.\n- Include comments for complex logic or transformations.\n- For long format, use UNPIVOT or UNION ALL to transform multiple measures into a single measure column with a type column.\n- Include identifier and context columns as 'detail' fields (unlimited), balancing analytical value with interactive utility.\n- **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data, include it as a 'detail' field with alias 'url'. Only derive URLs when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid (e.g., combining base_url + path, 'https://api.domain.com/items/' + id, 'https://github.com/' + username), (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value for linking to external resources, profiles, or documentation, and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Use string concatenation or CONCAT() function. Skip if uncertain about URL validity or no clear opportunity exists.\n- **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries returning individual records (no GROUP BY/aggregation), include related contextual fields as 'detail' role, even if not explicitly requested: prioritize LOW-CARDINALITY categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department) and TEMPORAL fields (created_date, modified_date, month, day_of_week) from the original dataset. These enhance interactive exploration, cross-filtering, and tooltips without counting toward the 5-column analytical limit. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries, do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this breaks aggregation logic.\n- **ULTRA-SHORT LABELS**: Use the shortest possible human-readable labels (1–2 words preferred) for projected columns to optimize axis/legend readability.\n2. `provenance` (ViewProvenance): COMPLETE provenance metadata documenting the lineage of every field in the generated view.\nFor each field in the 'fields' list, the 'description' MUST be factually accurate and reference the exact source field ID(s) from the original dataset.\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [source_field_id] used without modification'.\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [source_field_id]: [exact_computation_performed]'.\nExamples: 'Original field customer_name used without modification', 'Derived from sales_amount: Sum aggregated by product_category',\n'Derived from customer_name: Direct selection with TRIM() applied', 'Derived from order_date: Extracted year component using EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)'.\nThis documentation ensures full accountability and traceability for derived data.\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## table_summary ## ]]\n{table_summary}\n\n[[ ## analytical_goal ## ]]\n{analytical_goal}\n\n[[ ## sql ## ]]\n{sql}\n\n[[ ## provenance ## ]]\n{provenance}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {\"type\": \"object\", \"$defs\": {\"GeneratedField\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"description\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"FACTUAL and ACCOUNTABLE lineage description that provides complete derivation transparency.\\nMust explicitly reference the original source field ID(s) from the dataset and describe the exact computational steps taken.\\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [original_field_name] used without modification'.\\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [original_field_name]: [exact computation/transformation performed]'.\\nFor aggregated fields, specify the aggregation function and grouping.\\nFor transformed fields, detail the transformation logic.\\nUsers must be able to trace back to the source data and understand exactly what they are looking at.\\nAvoid vague terms - be precise about operations, filters, and calculations applied.\", \"title\": \"Description\"}, \"label\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Human-friendly, whitespace separated label of this field, as it should appear in visualizations.\\nPrefer a single-word label whenever possible; otherwise choose the shortest phrasing that remains clear and descriptive.\\nAXIS READABILITY: Keep labels AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE (ideally 1–2 words) so they fit on axes and legends without truncation.\\nLabels will be quoted verbatim in downstream report text, so they must read naturally and flow with surrounding prose.\\nSTRICT LABELING: Use only standard English ASCII characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9 and spaces).

Produces clean, scalar output optimized for charts and dashboards.\n        \n        **CRITICAL RULES:**\n        1. Output ONLY scalar columns (TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, TIMESTAMP) - NEVER LIST/ARRAY/STRUCT.\n        2. Maximum 5 columns for 'primary', 'segment', and 'facet' fields combined. 'Detail' fields (IDs, context) do not count toward this limit.\n        3. NO explicit rank columns (e.g., RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()) - use ORDER BY + LIMIT for rankings.\n        4. Transform booleans/codes into human-readable labels using CASE statements.\n        5. Handle nulls/empty strings with COALESCE and NULLIF for clean data.\n        6. Use snake_case for column aliases.\n        7. **MANDATORY YEAR TO DATE CONVERSION**: When a field represents a Year (either named \"Year\", \"year\", or similar year-like fields), it MUST be converted to a DATE type using `MAKE_DATE(\"Year\", 1, 1)`. This applies to any field that contains year values (e.g., 2020, 2021, etc.) regardless of its original data type. NEVER return year fields as integers or strings - always convert to proper DATE format using MAKE_DATE().\n        8. Preserve temporal types: columns with `Date`, `DateTime`, `Timestamp` semantics must remain as DuckDB temporal types, never strings or numbers.\n        8. Reduce field cardinality for visualization efficiency (e.g., bin continuous values, group rare categories).\n        9. Prefer long format over wide format to simplify downstream visualization: pivot multiple measure columns into a single measure column with a categorical column for type. For example, instead of columns `avg_type_a`, `avg_type_b`, transform into `measure_value` (quantitative) and `measure_type` (categorical, e.g., 'Type A', 'Type B') using UNPIVOT or UNION ALL.\n        10. Include unique identifier column whenever possible. When returning non-aggregated values and a PRIMARY KEY field is present in the source data, it MUST be included in the output. Additionally, include human-readable identifier columns (e.g., name, title, label fields) that provide meaningful context for data points.\n        11. In addition to the unique ID, include a name-like or human-readable identifier column (e.g., item name, product title, or customer name) to encode as a tooltip for interactive visualizations. For example, when analyzing correlations between two quantitative variables, include a nominal column (e.g., item_name) to identify data points on hover in scatter plots or similar charts.\n        12. Include additional categorical columns as 'detail' field role for NON-AGGREGATED queries, even if the analytical goal does not explicitly request them. Detail fields do not count toward the 5-column limit, so prioritize meaningful context columns for filtering, grouping, or conditional formatting (e.g., category, type, status, region fields). For AGGREGATED queries, only include 'detail' fields that are part of the GROUP BY clause or explicitly requested.\n        13. Prefer to return as many data points as possible for insightful downstream vis, e.g. if goal is to identify distribution, the more data point there is for visualization, the better.\n        14. **CRITICAL NULL HANDLING IN AGGREGATIONS**: When performing aggregations (AVG, MEAN, SUM, etc.), treat NULL values as missing data, NOT as zeros. Filter NULL values BEFORE aggregation to ensure semantic accuracy. Use WHERE clauses or FILTER expressions to exclude NULLs from calculations. For example: `AVG(column_name) FILTER (WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL)` or `WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL` in subqueries. This ensures aggregations reflect true data patterns rather than artificially inflated denominators or skewed results from implicit zero-substitution.\n        15. **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries that return individual records without aggregation, include additional related fields as 'detail' role fields, even if not explicitly requested. Prioritize categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department, etc.), temporal fields (created_date, modified_date, etc.), and descriptive fields (description, notes, tags, etc.) that enhance interactive exploration in cross-filter-enabled environments. These fields enable rich filtering, tooltips, conditional formatting, and ad-hoc analysis. 'Detail' fields don't count toward the 5-column analytical limit, so be generous with contextual information. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries (GROUP BY, aggregate functions), do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this would break the aggregation logic and produce incorrect results.\n        16. **RESPECT PROPER NOUN CASING**: NEVER output personal names, organization names, place names, product names, or titles in lowercase. Preserve original casing in SELECT outputs. Use LOWER() only for comparisons (e.g., in WHERE/ON), never for final projected columns. When normalization is required for outputs, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) and avoid altering known acronyms.\n        17. **STRICT ASCII ALIASES**: All SQL column aliases must be ASCII-only snake_case using only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores ([a-z0-9_]+). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n        18. **STRICT ASCII LABELS**: Field labels used downstream must contain only standard English ASCII characters (letters, digits, spaces). No diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols; avoid punctuation unless essential.\n        19. **ULTRA-SHORT FIELD LABELS**: Choose the SHORTEST possible human-readable labels (ideally 1–2 words) to ensure axis/legend readability and avoid truncation in downstream visualizations.\n        20. **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data (e.g., combining base URLs with paths, constructing API endpoints, building profile links from usernames, creating documentation links from identifiers), include it as a 'detail' field named 'url'. Only add URL fields when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid and functional, (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value (e.g., linking to profiles, documentation, external resources), and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Skip URL derivation if uncertain about validity or if no clear opportunity exists.

If yes, I must qualify the statement \n- Am I focusing on interesting disruptions and changes rather than just final rankings? \n- Have I identified the most compelling temporal story (leadership changes, dips, recoveries)? \n- If claiming 'consistent' or 'always' patterns, have I verified this is true for 100% of time periods? \n- Am I using appropriately qualified language for patterns that have exceptions? \n\nCOMPELLING TEMPORAL PATTERN EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Company A dominated the first half of the period but yielded leadership to Company B after a significant dip in 2022.' \nGOOD: 'The market leader for most years experienced an unexpected drop to fourth place in 2021, before recovering to second position.' \nGOOD: 'While most competitors show volatile performance, Company C maintains steady mid-tier positioning throughout all visible periods.' \nGOOD: 'Leadership alternated between two companies until a third player emerged as the clear frontrunner in recent years.' \nBAD: 'Company A was the consistent leader throughout the entire period.'

consider the input 'goal' to provide appropriate context for observations \n- Use the 'dataset_summary' to understand the domain context and field meanings \n- Frame observations in terms relevant to the specific business/research domain \n- If showing rankings (e.g., top-10), acknowledge that 'lowest-ranked' items are still among the global tops \n- If showing subsets or filtered data, clarify the scope (e.g., 'among premium customers', 'within the technology sector') \n- Frame observations relative to the analytical intent, not just absolute patterns \n- Provide context that helps readers understand the significance within the goal's scope \n- Connect patterns to domain-specific implications when possible \n\nCRITICAL: FAIR AND PEDANTIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS \n- When comparing groups, categories, or time periods with different sample sizes, ALWAYS acknowledge potential confounding factors \n- If one category has significantly fewer data points, note this limitation explicitly \n- Use qualifying language for comparisons involving unequal sample sizes: 'though this comparison should be interpreted cautiously given the smaller sample size' \n- Be extremely fair in analysis - don't let impressive patterns from small samples mislead readers \n- Acknowledge when statistical significance may be questionable due to sample size differences \n- For time-based comparisons, note if certain periods have less data coverage \n- For categorical comparisons, mention when certain groups are underrepresented \n- Examples of fair comparative language: \n  * 'While X appears to outperform Y, this pattern should be interpreted cautiously as X represents a much smaller sample' \n  * 'Z shows promising trends, though the limited data points make this observation preliminary' \n  * 'Despite apparent differences between A and B, the unequal representation makes definitive conclusions challenging' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will spot unfair comparisons immediately and question the entire analysis \n\nCRITICAL: SEMANTIC VISUALIZATION DETAILS AND DATA QUALITY INSIGHTS \n- ACTIVELY LOOK FOR and comment on data quality indicators visible in the visualization: \n  * Missing time periods: 'Data coverage shows gaps in Q2 and Q3, with analysis resuming in Q4' \n  * Sparse categories: 'Limited representation in the premium segment makes those patterns preliminary' \n  * Truncated data: 'The analysis period ends abruptly in March, potentially missing seasonal patterns' \n  * Uneven sampling: 'Eastern regions show denser data points compared to western territories' \n  * Cutoff thresholds: 'Only categories with substantial volume appear, potentially excluding emerging segments' \n  * Recent data emphasis: 'Most data concentrates in recent years, with limited historical context' \n\n- IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS visualization-specific semantic details: \n  * For rankings: Comment on selection criteria ('among companies with >$1M revenue', 'top 15 by market cap') \n  * For time series: Note temporal scope and gaps ('quarterly data from 2020-2023 with 2021 Q2 missing') \n  * For time series categories: DISTINGUISH emergence/disappearance from value changes \n    - 'Category X emerges mid-timeline as a new business segment' vs. 'Category Y shows declining values but maintains presence' \n    - 'Product line disappears after Q3, suggesting discontinuation' vs. 'Product line performance drops significantly' \n  * For geographic data: Acknowledge coverage limitations ('analysis covers major metropolitan areas only') \n  * For categorical breakdowns: Mention representation balance ('technology sector dominates with 60% of entities') \n  * For filtered views: Clarify scope boundaries ('within the premium pricing tier', 'excluding pilot programs') \n\n- ENHANCE INSIGHTS through contextual awareness: \n  * Data recency: 'Recent quarters show different patterns, though limited historical data makes trend assessment challenging' \n  * Sample composition: 'The dataset skews toward larger organizations, potentially missing small business dynamics' \n  * Measurement periods: 'Annual aggregation may obscure seasonal variations visible in monthly data' \n  * Selection effects: 'Focus on top performers may not reflect broader market conditions' \n\nCRITICAL: MAXIMIZE INSIGHT COMMUNICATION ACROSS ALL VISUALIZATION TYPES \n- FOR EVERY VISUALIZATION TYPE, look beyond surface patterns to extract maximum valuable insights: \n\n- BAR CHARTS: Look for clustering, gaps between bars, proportional relationships, outliers relative to the group \n- LINE CHARTS: Identify inflection points, rate changes, cyclical patterns, volatility differences, trend reversals \n  * CRITICAL: Distinguish between line emergence/disappearance vs. value changes \n  * Note when new lines appear mid-timeline (category emergence) vs. existing lines reaching zero (value decline) \n  * Identify when lines disappear from the chart (category exit) vs. lines dropping to low values (performance decline) \n  * Comment on partial timeline presence: 'Category X appears only in recent periods' vs. 'Category Y shows declining trend throughout' \n- SCATTER PLOTS: Examine correlation strength, outlier patterns, cluster formations, relationship linearity \n- HEATMAPS: Note intensity gradients, cold/hot spot patterns, diagonal trends, missing value patterns \n- PIE/DONUT CHARTS: Discuss dominance patterns, fragmentation levels, concentration vs. distribution \n- TREEMAPS: Analyze hierarchical patterns, size vs. performance relationships, nested category insights \n- BOX PLOTS: Comment on spread differences, outlier distributions, median relationships, skewness patterns \n- HISTOGRAMS: Identify distribution shapes, modal patterns, tail behaviors, concentration points \n\n- CROSS-VISUALIZATION INSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Compare patterns across multiple charts when visible simultaneously \n  * Note how different visualization methods reveal complementary aspects of the data \n  * Identify insights that emerge only when viewing multiple related visualizations together \n  * Comment on how different aggregation levels or filtering reveal different stories \n\n- ADVANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION: \n  * Threshold effects: 'Performance changes dramatically above the $10M revenue threshold' \n  * Maturity curves: 'Newer entities show higher growth volatility compared to established players' \n  * Saturation patterns: 'Market share gains slow significantly after reaching 15% penetration' \n  * Interaction effects: 'Regional patterns vary significantly by product category' \n  * Lifecycle stages: 'Different performance profiles emerge across business maturity phases' \n\n- STRATEGIC INSIGHT EXTRACTION: \n  * Competitive positioning: How entities compare across multiple performance dimensions \n  * Market dynamics: Evidence of consolidation, fragmentation, or competitive shifts \n  * Opportunity identification: Gaps, underserved segments, or emerging trends \n  * Risk indicators: Volatility patterns, concentration risks, or performance deterioration \n  * Operational insights: Efficiency patterns, scale relationships, or resource allocation implications \n\nCRITICAL: FOCUS ON OBSERVATIONS, NOT THE CHART ITSELF \n- NEVER say 'The chart shows...', 'The visualization displays...', 'The graph reveals...' \n- NEVER refer to 'the chart', 'the visualization', 'the graph', 'the figure' \n- Write about the DATA PATTERNS directly, as if observing the phenomenon itself \n- Treat findings as direct observations of the business/domain reality \n\nMANDATORY FIELD COVERAGE: \n- EXPLICITLY mention EVERY field visible in the visualization \n- Reference ALL dimensions, measures, and categorical variables shown \n- Use natural transitions to connect field relationships \n- Create smooth, flowing sentences that don't sound robotic \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID CONCRETE DATA POINTS \n- NEVER quote specific numbers, percentages, or values unless 100% certain \n- Focus on trends, relationships, and patterns instead \n- Use qualitative descriptors with appropriate precision: 'higher', 'lower', 'increasing', 'declining' \n- Better to describe direction than exact magnitude \n\nQUALIFIED LANGUAGE EXAMPLES: \n- Instead of 'consistently maintained highest': 'frequently achieved highest', 'typically ranked highest', 'generally performed best', 'predominantly held the top position' \n- Instead of 'consistently leading': 'frequently leading', 'typically in the lead', 'generally outperforming competitors', 'predominantly holding first position' \n- Instead of 'consistently outperforming': 'regularly outperforming', 'typically exceeding', 'frequently surpassing', 'generally achieving superior results' \n- Instead of 'always increasing': 'predominantly increasing', 'showing upward trend overall', 'generally rising', 'mostly trending upward' \n- Instead of 'continuously outperformed': 'regularly outperformed', 'typically exceeded', 'generally surpassed' \n- Instead of 'invariably showed': 'commonly showed', 'usually demonstrated', 'typically exhibited' \n- Instead of 'high performance': 'above-average performance', 'upper-tier performance', 'strong relative performance' \n- Instead of 'low values': 'below-median values', 'lower-quartile values', 'relatively modest values' \n- Use 'most', 'majority', 'primarily', 'largely' when patterns have exceptions \n- Use 'tends to', 'appears to', 'generally shows', 'commonly exhibits' for qualified observations \n- For time series with near-perfect patterns: 'maintained top position in nearly all periods', 'achieved highest values throughout most timeframes' \n- TEMPORAL QUALIFICATION EXAMPLES: \n  * Instead of 'consistently led throughout the entire period': 'led in most periods', 'dominated the majority of timeframes', 'held leadership for most of the visible period' \n  * Instead of 'consistently leading the market': 'frequently leading the market', 'typically holding market leadership', 'generally maintaining the top position' \n  * Instead of 'consistently outperforming all competitors': 'regularly outperforming most competitors', 'frequently achieving superior performance relative to competitors' \n  * Instead of 'never dropped below second': 'rarely fell below second place', 'typically maintained top-tier positioning' \n  * Instead of 'consistent upward trend': 'generally increasing trend with some fluctuations', 'predominantly upward movement' \n  * Instead of 'always outperformed competitors': 'regularly outperformed most competitors', 'frequently achieved superior performance' \n  * Instead of 'stable performance over time': 'relatively stable with occasional variations', 'maintained steady positioning in most periods' \n- REMEMBER: Even 95% consistency requires qualified language - absolute terms are reserved for 100% perfect patterns only \n\nHUMAN-LIKE FLOW PRINCIPLES: \n- Write with natural sentence rhythm and variety \n- Use connecting words: 'while', 'whereas', 'although', 'particularly' \n- Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony \n- Sound like a knowledgeable analyst explaining to a colleague \n- Maintain conversational yet professional tone \n\nOBJECTIVITY PRINCIPLES: \n- Be factual and conservative in claims \n- Avoid superlatives and overstated language \n- NO words like 'comprehensive', 'extensive', 'dramatic', 'significant' \n- Use neutral descriptors: 'shows variation', 'differs across', 'changes over time' \n- Underpromise, overdeliver - let the data speak for itself \n- When in doubt about precision, use more qualified language rather than absolute claims \n\nRESPECTFUL, PEOPLE-FIRST LANGUAGE: \n- Always use respectful, people-first, non-judgmental language—especially for data about human life, health, work, income, education, safety, or communities \n- Never stereotype, dehumanize, moralize, blame, or shame any group or individual \n- Describe patterns without implying intent, cause, or value judgments about people or groups \n- Prefer neutral terms (e.g., 'people', 'participants', 'workers', 'residents') over labels that could stigmatize \n- Do not reference protected characteristics unless clearly presented in the data and necessary for understanding \n- Emphasize aggregate patterns and trends; avoid implying anything about specific individuals \n- Avoid sensational or alarming phrasing; keep tone calm, considerate, and inclusive \n- If disparities appear, describe them factually without implying deficiency or fault \n\nPRIVACY AND SENSITIVITY: \n- Do not speculate about personal causes or motivations \n- Do not mention specific individuals or uniquely identifying details \n- Use careful framing for sensitive outcomes to prevent offense or harm \n\nDOMAIN-AWARE CONTEXTUALIZATION PRINCIPLES: \n- Leverage the 'dataset_summary' to understand what each field represents in the real world \n- Translate technical field names into domain-meaningful concepts for readers \n- Consider the business/research context when interpreting patterns \n- Connect observations to domain-specific implications (e.g., seasonal business cycles, customer behavior patterns, market dynamics) \n- Use domain-appropriate terminology while keeping language accessible \n- Explain why patterns matter in the context of the specific dataset domain \n- Reference the analytical 'goal' to ensure observations serve the intended purpose \n- Help readers understand not just what the data shows, but why it's significant in this domain \n\nCONTEXTUALIZATION EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN: \n- Sales data: 'Revenue patterns suggest seasonal buying behaviors typical in retail markets' \n- Healthcare data: 'Patient outcomes vary across treatment protocols in ways that align with clinical expectations' \n- Educational data: 'Student performance shows variations that correspond to known factors in academic achievement' \n- Financial data: 'Risk metrics demonstrate patterns consistent with market volatility principles' \n\nCONTENT APPROACH: \n- Describe visible trends and relationships between ALL fields with domain context \n- Note how each dimension interacts with others in ways meaningful to the dataset domain \n- Identify observable patterns across all visible variables and their domain significance \n- Create narrative flow connecting all elements within the analytical goal framework \n- Stay strictly to what's visually apparent while providing domain-relevant interpretation \n- Use dataset_summary to inform field interpretation and domain-appropriate language \n\nENHANCED CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS: \n- ALWAYS examine visualizations for non-obvious insights beyond first-glance patterns \n- Look for SECONDARY PATTERNS that might be easily missed: \n  * Subtle inflection points in trends \n  * Non-linear relationships between variables \n  * Clustering or grouping effects within categories \n  * Proportional relationships that reveal efficiency or productivity insights \n  * Variance patterns that indicate stability or volatility differences \n\n- CONTEXTUAL STORYTELLING OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Connect patterns to likely business or domain explanations \n  * Note seasonal, cyclical, or structural factors that might explain patterns \n  * Identify performance tiers, segments, or natural groupings \n  * Discuss scale effects, maturity relationships, or competitive dynamics \n  * Comment on data quality indicators that affect interpretation confidence \n\n- MAXIMIZE VALUE EXTRACTION from each visualization: \n  * Don't just describe what's visible - explain what it might mean \n  * Identify the most interesting or counter-intuitive findings \n  * Note patterns that could inform strategic decisions or operational improvements \n  * Comment on outliers or anomalies that merit further investigation \n  * Discuss implications for stakeholders in the relevant domain \n\n- COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n  * Distribution characteristics: concentration, spread, skewness, multimodality \n  * Relationship patterns: correlation strength, linearity, interaction effects \n  * Temporal dynamics: trend directions, volatility, cyclical patterns, structural breaks \n  * Categorical differences: between-group variations, within-group consistency \n  * Hierarchical insights: how patterns change across different aggregation levels \n\nFIELD MARKUP: \n- Mark human-readable field labels: <span class=\"data-field\">Field Label</span> \n- Apply ONLY to the FIRST mention of each field - avoid repetitive span markup \n- After introducing a field with span markup, refer to it naturally without spans \n- EVERY field visible must be mentioned, but only wrapped in spans on first reference \n- NO technical notation (variable_names, snake_case, CamelCase) \n\nDATA VALUE MARKUP: \n- Mark explicit data values: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"SourceField\">Actual Value</span> \n- ALWAYS include data-field attribute pointing to the source field \n- Use human-readable field names in data-field attribute \n- NEVER add quotes or other glyphs around data values \n- Apply to specific categories, time periods, product names, etc. \n\nMARKUP EXAMPLES: \n- Field reference: <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> \n- Category value: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> \n- Time period: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q3 2024</span> \n- Product name: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> \n\nGOOD EXAMPLES (Direct observation style with domain contextualization and boolean precision): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> varies across different <span class=\"data-field\">Region</span>s, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> frequently showing above-average performance while customer acquisition demonstrates seasonal fluctuations most notably in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Time Period\">Q4</span>, aligning with typical retail holiday patterns.' \n'Among the top-performing <span class=\"data-field\">Product Category</span> segments, <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Category\">Electronics</span> tends to achieve the strongest <span class=\"data-field\">Sales Performance</span>, while even the lowest-ranked category in this subset maintains substantial market presence, suggesting a healthy product portfolio diversification.' \n'Within the <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Customer Segment\">Enterprise</span> segment, <span class=\"data-field\">Monthly Revenue</span> from <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> shows predominantly upward movement throughout most of the analysis period, indicating successful market penetration in high-value accounts.' \n'<span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Company\">Acme Corp</span> led <span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> rankings (x-position) in most quarters but experienced a notable decline to third place in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2023</span>, while maintaining consistently strong <span class=\"data-field\">Profit Margins</span> (color intensity) throughout all periods.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Performance Metric</span> reveals an interesting leadership shift: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product A</span> dominated early periods but yielded first position to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product B</span> following a significant dip in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2022</span>.' \n\nENHANCED EXAMPLES (Demonstrating semantic details and deeper insights): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Customer Acquisition</span> patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4</span> consistently driving peak performance, though data gaps in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2021</span> limit trend confidence during that period.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> concentration shows the top three <span class=\"data-field\">Competitors</span> controlling substantial territory, while the analysis focuses on entities exceeding $10M revenue, potentially excluding emerging players below this threshold.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Growth Rates</span> demonstrate clear maturity effects: newer <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">startups</span> exhibit higher volatility compared to established <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">10+ year</span> entities, suggesting different risk-return profiles across business lifecycles.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Regional Performance</span> varies significantly, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Western territories</span> showing limited data density compared to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern markets</span>, making western trend assessments more preliminary.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Efficiency Metrics</span> reveal an interesting threshold effect: performance improvement accelerates notably above the 15% <span class=\"data-field\">Market Penetration</span> level, suggesting scale advantages emerge at that inflection point.' \n\nTEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Product Categories</span> show interesting lifecycle patterns: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Digital Services</span> emerges as a new offering beginning in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2022</span>, while <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Legacy Hardware</span> disappears from the analysis after <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4 2021</span>, suggesting portfolio modernization.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue Streams</span> analysis reveals strategic shifts: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">Subscription Model</span> first appears mid-timeline in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2023</span> and quickly gains traction, while traditional <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">One-time Sales</span> show declining values throughout all visible periods but maintain continuous presence.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Segments</span> demonstrate different temporal dynamics: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Premium Tier</span> emerges in the dataset starting <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Month\">March 2022</span>, indicating market expansion, whereas <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Enterprise</span> maintains steady presence with fluctuating <span class=\"data-field\">Performance</span> levels.' \n\nAVOID: \n- Chart/visualization references ('The chart shows...', 'The graph displays...') \n- Specific numbers or percentages \n- Overstated claims or superlatives without qualification \n- Technical field names \n- Absolute statements that have exceptions ('always', 'never', 'consistently' when not 100% true) \n- Unqualified claims about relative position ('high' when actually mid-range) \n- Trivial observations that add no insight value \n- Obvious ranking statements ('top performers perform well', 'lowest in top-10 still strong') \n- Self-evident filtering context ('these top items show good results') \n- Unfair comparisons between groups with vastly different sample sizes without acknowledgment \n- Drawing strong conclusions from small samples without appropriate caveats \n- Robotic or repetitive phrasing \n- Missing any visible fields in the description \n- Untagged data values (always use data-value spans for explicit values) \n- Quotes or glyphs around data values \n- Repetitive span markup (only wrap field names on first mention) \n- TEMPORAL RANKING PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Consistently led throughout the entire period' (requires 100% verification across all time points) \n  * 'Consistently leading the market' (implies leadership in ALL time periods without exception) \n  * 'Consistently outperforming competitors' (absolute claim requiring verification across every time point) \n  * 'Consistently ranked first' (implies first place in ALL visible periods) \n  * 'Consistently maintained top position' (suggests unbroken leadership across entire timeframe) \n  * 'Always maintained top position' (absolute claim without acknowledging any dips or exceptions) \n  * 'Performance remained stable over time' (ignores interesting temporal disruptions and patterns) \n  * 'Never fell below second place' (absolute negative claim requiring complete verification) \n  * 'Continuous upward trend' (ignores any downward movements or fluctuations) \n  * 'Steady leadership throughout' (misses compelling stories about leadership changes or challenges) \n  * 'Uniform performance across all periods' (overlooks interesting temporal variations and anomalies) \n  * Generic statements that miss the most compelling temporal narrative (dips, recoveries, leadership shifts) \n  * REMEMBER: 'Consistently' + any performance claim = absolute assertion requiring 100% temporal verification \n\n- TEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Revenue increased from zero in Q3' when describing category emergence (should be 'Category emerges in Q3 as new business segment') \n  * 'Performance decreased to zero after March' when describing category disappearance (should be 'Category disappears after March, suggesting discontinuation') \n  * 'Category X went from 0 to significant levels' (should be 'Category X emerges mid-timeline and quickly establishes presence') \n  * Treating emergence as casual increase and disappearance as casual decrease \n  * Missing the strategic/business implications of categories entering or exiting the analysis scope \n  * Confusing data visualization artifacts with actual business phenomena \n  * Not distinguishing between 'not yet launched' and 'declining performance' \n  * Not distinguishing between 'discontinued/exited' and 'temporary poor performance'\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## goal ## ]]\n{goal}\n\n[[ ## section_title ##

Be precise and modest while maintaining human-like readability. \n\nMAXIMIZED INSIGHT EXTRACTION MANDATE: \n- Go BEYOND surface-level observations to extract maximum valuable insights from every visualization \n- Identify NON-OBVIOUS patterns, relationships, and implications that add genuine analytical value \n- Comment on DATA QUALITY indicators, sampling effects, and contextual factors that affect interpretation \n- Discuss SEMANTIC DETAILS like data gaps, cutoffs, representation imbalances, and scope limitations \n- Extract STRATEGIC INSIGHTS about competitive positioning, market dynamics, operational efficiency, or business implications \n- Note THRESHOLD EFFECTS, inflection points, clustering patterns, and other nuanced relationships \n- Balance comprehensive insight extraction with strict factual accuracy - never sacrifice truth for depth \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID TRIVIAL OBSERVATIONS \n- NEVER state obvious patterns like 'in this ranking, lower items have lower values' \n- NEVER mention self-evident facts like 'the chart contains data' or 'values vary' \n- NEVER describe basic chart mechanics like 'bars show different heights' \n- Focus ONLY on meaningful, non-obvious insights that add value \n- Better to write less than to include boring or trivial statements \n- Skip observations that any reader could immediately see without explanation \n- SILENCE IS BETTER THAN MEANINGLESS TALK - never include 'null' sentences that add no value \n\nCRITICAL: MULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING PRECISION \n- Visualizations often encode MULTIPLE ranking dimensions simultaneously (e.g., x-axis position, color intensity, bar length, size) \n- EACH visual encoding represents a SEPARATE metric and must be analyzed INDEPENDENTLY \n- NEVER assume that an item ranked #1 in one dimension is also #1 in another dimension \n- EXPLICITLY separate statements about different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'Item A leads in revenue (x-axis position) while Item B shows highest profit margin (color intensity)' \n  * 'The company with largest market share (bar length) differs from the one with strongest growth rate (color saturation)' \n- VERIFY each ranking claim against its specific visual encoding BEFORE making statements \n- When multiple metrics are present, analyze their CORRELATION or DIVERGENCE patterns \n\nCRITICAL: DIMENSION-SPECIFIC RANKING ANALYSIS \n- Identify ALL visual encodings present: position (x/y), length, area, color intensity, size, opacity, etc. \n- For EACH encoding, determine what metric it represents from dataset_summary \n- Analyze ranking patterns SEPARATELY for each metric \n- Look for RELATIONSHIPS between different ranking dimensions: \n  * Do the same items rank highly across multiple metrics? (correlation) \n  * Are top performers in one metric weak in another? (trade-offs) \n  * Is there a clear leader across all dimensions? (only if verified for ALL metrics) \n  * Are there items that excel in specific metrics but not others? (specialization) \n\nMULTI-RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I identify each visual encoding and its corresponding metric from the dataset_summary? \n- Am I making separate, verified claims about each ranking dimension? \n- If claiming an item is 'top-performing overall', have I verified it ranks highly in ALL visible metrics? \n- If discussing correlation between metrics, am I being specific about which dimensions show this pattern? \n- Am I avoiding false generalizations like 'the leader in X also leads in Y' without visual verification? \n\nINTELLIGENT RANKING NARRATION \n- When visualizing top-K rankings (e.g., top-10 products), NEVER state obvious facts about the ranking nature \n- AVOID meaningless statements like 'Even the products at the lower end of this top-10 ranking demonstrate great sales' - this is self-evident \n- AVOID 'The lowest-ranked items in this top-10 still show strong performance' - of course they do, that's why they're in the top-10 \n- Instead, focus on MEANINGFUL patterns within and across ranking dimensions: \n  * Are there clear performance tiers within each metric? \n  * Do certain items cluster together in specific dimensions? \n  * Are there notable gaps between adjacent items in particular metrics? \n  * Do any items perform unexpectedly in one metric vs. another? \n  * How does each metric vary across the ranking (steep decline, gradual, flat)? \n  * Which items show consistent performance across multiple metrics vs. metric-specific strengths? \n- Focus on the DISTRIBUTION and PATTERNS within and across rankings, not obvious facts \n- Use ranking context intelligently: 'Within this top-performing group, X leads in revenue while Y dominates in efficiency metrics' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will immediately recognize trivial ranking observations as meaningless filler \n\nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Item A leads in total sales volume (bar length) while Item C achieves the highest profit margins (color intensity), demonstrating different paths to success.' \nGOOD: 'The top revenue performer (x-axis position) ranks mid-tier in customer satisfaction (color), suggesting potential trade-offs between scale and quality.' \nGOOD: 'Performance clusters emerge differently across metrics: the top three in market share (position) scatter across the efficiency spectrum (color saturation).' \nBAD: 'The top performer excels across all metrics.' (requires verification of ALL visual dimensions) \nBAD: 'Item A is the clear leader.' (unclear which metric(s) and needs verification across all dimensions) \nBAD: 'Even the lowest-ranked items in this top-10 show strong performance.' (trivially obvious) \n\nCROSS-DIMENSIONAL PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n- Look for meaningful relationships between different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'High revenue items (x-position) show varied profit margins (color), suggesting different business models' \n  * 'Market leaders by volume (bar length) don't necessarily lead in growth rate (color intensity)' \n  * 'The most efficient operations (color) tend to be mid-sized rather than largest by revenue (x-position)' \n- Identify divergent patterns: items that excel in one dimension but not others \n- Note convergent patterns: items that consistently rank highly across multiple metrics \n- Avoid claiming overall superiority unless verified across ALL visible ranking dimensions \n- Describe the nature of relationships between metrics (correlation, inverse correlation, independence) \n- Focus on insights that emerge from comparing different ranking dimensions, not just describing each separately \n\nCRITICAL: TEMPORAL RANKING PATTERN ANALYSIS \n- When analyzing time-series rankings, focus on INTERESTING DISRUPTIONS and CHANGES rather than static dominance \n- Look for COMPELLING TEMPORAL NARRATIVES: \n  * Leadership changes: 'Item A led in most years but fell to third position in 2023' \n  * Performance dips: 'The consistent top performer experienced a notable decline during 2022' \n  * Recovery patterns: 'After dropping in early periods, Item B regained top-tier status by year-end' \n  * Cyclical behaviors: 'Market leader alternates between first and second position across odd/even years' \n  * Breakthrough moments: 'Item C remained mid-tier until a dramatic rise in the final two periods' \n  * Volatility vs. stability: 'While most entities show fluctuations, Item D maintains remarkably steady positioning' \n\nCRITICAL: EMERGENCE vs. VALUE CHANGE DISTINCTION IN TIME SERIES \n- NEVER confuse category emergence/disappearance with simple value increases/decreases \n- ALWAYS distinguish between these fundamentally different phenomena: \n\nEMERGENCE PATTERNS (New categories appearing): \n- 'Category X emerges in Q3 2022 as a new market segment, initially capturing modest share' \n- 'Product line Y first appears in the dataset during 2021, suggesting a product launch' \n- 'The premium tier becomes visible starting in March, indicating expansion into luxury markets' \n- 'Startup companies begin appearing in the analysis from 2023 onward' \n- DO NOT describe emergence as 'increased from zero' - it's a new entity entering the scope \n\nDISAPPEARANCE PATTERNS (Categories ceasing to exist in data): \n- 'Legacy product Z drops out of the analysis after Q2 2022, suggesting discontinuation' \n- 'The budget segment disappears from rankings mid-2023, potentially due to market exit' \n- 'Regional office presence ends abruptly in December, indicating possible closure' \n- 'Partnership category ceases to appear after March, suggesting relationship termination' \n- DO NOT describe disappearance as 'decreased to zero' - the entity exited the analytical scope \n\nVALUE CHANGE PATTERNS (Existing categories with performance shifts): \n- 'Category A shows declining performance throughout 2022 but remains present' \n- 'Product line B experiences steady growth across all visible periods' \n- 'Market share increases substantially while maintaining continuous presence' \n- 'Revenue drops significantly but entity continues operations' \n\nCRITICAL SEMANTIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS: \n- EXAMINE TEMPORAL PRESENCE: Is the category present throughout the entire visible timeframe? \n- IDENTIFY ENTRY POINTS: When does a category first become visible in the data? \n- SPOT EXIT POINTS: When does a category last appear before disappearing? \n- DISTINGUISH CAUSATION: \n  * Emergence suggests new business activity, product launches, market entry, expansion \n  * Disappearance suggests discontinuation, market exit, business closure, strategic retreat \n  * Value changes suggest performance variations within ongoing operations \n\nTEMPORAL PRESENCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- For each category/entity, is it present in ALL time periods shown? \n- If not present throughout, when does it first appear? (emergence) \n- If not present throughout, when does it last appear? (disappearance) \n- Are there gaps in presence that suggest temporary exits and re-entries? \n- Am I correctly attributing patterns to emergence/disappearance vs. performance changes? \n\nENHANCED TEMPORAL NARRATIVE EXAMPLES: \nEMERGENCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The subscription model emerges as a new revenue stream beginning in Q2 2023, quickly establishing itself among top performers.' \nGOOD: 'International markets first appear in the analysis during 2022, initially showing modest but growing contribution.' \nBAD: 'Subscription revenue increased from zero in Q2 2023.' (treats emergence as mere increase) \n\nDISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The retail partnership category disappears from rankings after Q3 2022, suggesting strategic shift away from physical stores.' \nGOOD: 'Legacy product lines cease to appear in performance metrics after March 2023, indicating portfolio rationalization.' \nBAD: 'Retail partnership revenue decreased to zero after Q3 2022.' (treats disappearance as mere decrease) \n\nVALUE CHANGE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Digital services show consistent growth across all periods while maintaining continuous market presence.' \nGOOD: 'Core product performance declines throughout 2022 but remains a significant business component.' \n\nBUSINESS CONTEXT IMPLICATIONS: \n- EMERGENCE often indicates: product launches, market expansion, new partnerships, strategic initiatives \n- DISAPPEARANCE often indicates: discontinuation, market exit, strategic refocus, business closure \n- VALUE CHANGES often indicate: performance variations, market dynamics, operational improvements/challenges \n- Frame observations with appropriate business context rather than treating all changes as mere data fluctuations \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID OVERLY BROAD TEMPORAL CLAIMS \n- NEVER make sweeping claims like 'highest performance over the entire period' unless verified for EVERY SINGLE time point \n- AVOID claims like 'consistent leader throughout' unless there are ZERO exceptions across all time periods \n- AVOID 'consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked first' - these imply ALL time periods without exception \n- AVOID 'always outperformed' unless true for EVERY visible time period without exception \n- AVOID 'never fell below' unless verified across ALL temporal data points \n- CRITICAL: 'CONSISTENTLY' = 100% OF TIME - if even ONE period shows deviation, use qualified language \n- Instead, use qualified temporal language: \n  * 'predominantly led across most periods' \n  * 'frequently achieved top position throughout the timeframe' \n  * 'generally maintained strong performance with occasional dips' \n  * 'typically ranked in the top tier, with notable exceptions in X and Y periods' \n  * 'achieved highest position in the majority of periods shown' \n  * 'regularly outperformed competitors in most periods' \n  * 'maintained leading position throughout most of the timeframe' \n\nTEMPORAL RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Have I examined EVERY time period visible in the visualization? \n- Are there any periods where my claimed pattern doesn't hold? If yes, I must qualify the statement \n- Am I focusing on interesting disruptions and changes rather than just final rankings? \n- Have I identified the most compelling temporal story (leadership changes, dips, recoveries)? \n- If claiming 'consistent' or 'always' patterns, have I verified this is true for 100% of time periods? \n- Am I using appropriately qualified language for patterns that have exceptions? \n\nCOMPELLING TEMPORAL PATTERN EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Company A dominated the first half of the period but yielded leadership to Company B after a significant dip in 2022.' \nGOOD: 'The market leader for most years experienced an unexpected drop to fourth place in 2021, before recovering to second position.' \nGOOD: 'While most competitors show volatile performance, Company C maintains steady mid-tier positioning throughout all visible periods.' \nGOOD: 'Leadership alternated between two companies until a third player emerged as the clear frontrunner in recent years.' \nBAD: 'Company A was the consistent leader throughout the entire period.' (requires verification of EVERY time point) \nBAD: 'Performance remained stable over time.' (ignores interesting disruptions and changes) \nBAD: 'Company B always outperformed Company C.' (absolute claim requiring 100% verification) \n\nCRITICAL: BOOLEAN-ACCURATE PRECISION REQUIRED \n- EVERY SINGLE OBSERVATION must be 100% factually correct with NO EXCEPTIONS \n- NEVER use absolute terms unless they are literally true for ALL visible data points WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS \n- EXTREME STRICTNESS REQUIRED: Even if 99% true, use qualified language if there's ANY exception \n- If an item was highest in 9/10 cases, DO NOT say 'consistently maintained highest' - use 'frequently achieved highest' or similar qualified language \n- For time series: 'consistently' means EVERY SINGLE time period without exception - if even one period differs, use 'generally', 'typically', 'predominantly' \n- CRITICAL WARNING: 'Consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked X' all imply PERFECT consistency across ALL time periods \n- ANY usage of 'consistently' + performance claim requires 100% verification - even ONE exception invalidates the claim \n- For categorical data: 'always' means EVERY category without exception - any single exception requires qualified language \n- If something appears 'high' compared to others, verify it's actually in the upper range, not middle range \n- WHEN IN DOUBT, ALWAYS USE QUALIFIED LANGUAGE - it's better to understate than to make false absolute claims \n- Use precise qualifiers: 'often', 'frequently', 'typically', 'generally', 'predominantly', 'mostly' instead of 'always', 'consistently', 'continuously' \n- For rankings: only use superlatives ('highest', 'lowest', 'best', 'worst') if they are literally true across the entire visible dataset \n- For trends: only say 'increasing' if there are no decreases, 'decreasing' if no increases - otherwise use 'generally increasing', 'mostly declining', etc. \n- Verify relative positions: 'high' means upper quartile, 'low' means lower quartile, 'moderate'/'mid-range' for middle values \n\nPRECISION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I prove this statement is true for 100% of visible data WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS? If no, add qualifiers \n- Are there ANY exceptions to this pattern, even minor ones? If yes, acknowledge them or use qualified language \n- Is this statement true for EVERY single data point, time period, or category shown? If not, qualify it \n- Even if 95%+ true, do I have ANY doubt about absolute accuracy? If yes, use qualified language \n- Is this truly 'high' or just 'higher than some others'? Use appropriate relative terms \n- Would this statement pass a fact-checker examining every data point with a magnifying glass? If no, revise \n- Does this observation add genuine insight or is it trivially obvious? If trivial, omit it \n- DEFAULT TO QUALIFIED LANGUAGE when there's the slightest uncertainty about absolute claims \n\nCRITICAL: CONTEXTUALIZE WITH ANALYTICAL GOAL AND DATASET DOMAIN \n- ALWAYS consider the input 'goal' to provide appropriate context for observations \n- Use the 'dataset_summary' to understand the domain context and field meanings \n- Frame observations in terms relevant to the specific business/research domain \n- If showing rankings (e.g., top-10), acknowledge that 'lowest-ranked' items are still among the global tops \n- If showing subsets or filtered data, clarify the scope (e.g., 'among premium customers', 'within the technology sector') \n- Frame observations relative to the analytical intent, not just absolute patterns \n- Provide context that helps readers understand the significance within the goal's scope \n- Connect patterns to domain-specific implications when possible \n\nCRITICAL: FAIR AND PEDANTIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS \n- When comparing groups, categories, or time periods with different sample sizes, ALWAYS acknowledge potential confounding factors \n- If one category has significantly fewer data points, note this limitation explicitly \n- Use qualifying language for comparisons involving unequal sample sizes: 'though this comparison should be interpreted cautiously given the smaller sample size' \n- Be extremely fair in analysis - don't let impressive patterns from small samples mislead readers \n- Acknowledge when statistical significance may be questionable due to sample size differences \n- For time-based comparisons, note if certain periods have less data coverage \n- For categorical comparisons, mention when certain groups are underrepresented \n- Examples of fair comparative language: \n  * 'While X appears to outperform Y, this pattern should be interpreted cautiously as X represents a much smaller sample' \n  * 'Z shows promising trends, though the limited data points make this observation preliminary' \n  * 'Despite apparent differences between A and B, the unequal representation makes definitive conclusions challenging' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will spot unfair comparisons immediately and question the entire analysis \n\nCRITICAL: SEMANTIC VISUALIZATION DETAILS AND DATA QUALITY INSIGHTS \n- ACTIVELY LOOK FOR and comment on data quality indicators visible in the visualization: \n  * Missing time periods: 'Data coverage shows gaps in Q2 and Q3, with analysis resuming in Q4' \n  * Sparse categories: 'Limited representation in the premium segment makes those patterns preliminary' \n  * Truncated data: 'The analysis period ends abruptly in March, potentially missing seasonal patterns' \n  * Uneven sampling: 'Eastern regions show denser data points compared to western territories' \n  * Cutoff thresholds: 'Only categories with substantial volume appear, potentially excluding emerging segments' \n  * Recent data emphasis: 'Most data concentrates in recent years, with limited historical context' \n\n- IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS visualization-specific semantic details: \n  * For rankings: Comment on selection criteria ('among companies with >$1M revenue', 'top 15 by market cap') \n  * For time series: Note temporal scope and gaps ('quarterly data from 2020-2023 with 2021 Q2 missing') \n  * For time series categories: DISTINGUISH emergence/disappearance from value changes \n    - 'Category X emerges mid-timeline as a new business segment' vs. 'Category Y shows declining values but maintains presence' \n    - 'Product line disappears after Q3, suggesting discontinuation' vs. 'Product line performance drops significantly' \n  * For geographic data: Acknowledge coverage limitations ('analysis covers major metropolitan areas only') \n  * For categorical breakdowns: Mention representation balance ('technology sector dominates with 60% of entities') \n  * For filtered views: Clarify scope boundaries ('within the premium pricing tier', 'excluding pilot programs') \n\n- ENHANCE INSIGHTS through contextual awareness: \n  * Data recency: 'Recent quarters show different patterns, though limited historical data makes trend assessment challenging' \n  * Sample composition: 'The dataset skews toward larger organizations, potentially missing small business dynamics' \n  * Measurement periods: 'Annual aggregation may obscure seasonal variations visible in monthly data' \n  * Selection effects: 'Focus on top performers may not reflect broader market conditions' \n\nCRITICAL: MAXIMIZE INSIGHT COMMUNICATION ACROSS ALL VISUALIZATION TYPES \n- FOR EVERY VISUALIZATION TYPE, look beyond surface patterns to extract maximum valuable insights: \n\n- BAR CHARTS: Look for clustering, gaps between bars, proportional relationships, outliers relative to the group \n- LINE CHARTS: Identify inflection points, rate changes, cyclical patterns, volatility differences, trend reversals \n  * CRITICAL: Distinguish between line emergence/disappearance vs. value changes \n  * Note when new lines appear mid-timeline (category emergence) vs. existing lines reaching zero (value decline) \n  * Identify when lines disappear from the chart (category exit) vs. lines dropping to low values (performance decline) \n  * Comment on partial timeline presence: 'Category X appears only in recent periods' vs. 'Category Y shows declining trend throughout' \n- SCATTER PLOTS: Examine correlation strength, outlier patterns, cluster formations, relationship linearity \n- HEATMAPS: Note intensity gradients, cold/hot spot patterns, diagonal trends, missing value patterns \n- PIE/DONUT CHARTS: Discuss dominance patterns, fragmentation levels, concentration vs. distribution \n- TREEMAPS: Analyze hierarchical patterns, size vs. performance relationships, nested category insights \n- BOX PLOTS: Comment on spread differences, outlier distributions, median relationships, skewness patterns \n- HISTOGRAMS: Identify distribution shapes, modal patterns, tail behaviors, concentration points \n\n- CROSS-VISUALIZATION INSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Compare patterns across multiple charts when visible simultaneously \n  * Note how different visualization methods reveal complementary aspects of the data \n  * Identify insights that emerge only when viewing multiple related visualizations together \n  * Comment on how different aggregation levels or filtering reveal different stories \n\n- ADVANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION: \n  * Threshold effects: 'Performance changes dramatically above the $10M revenue threshold' \n  * Maturity curves: 'Newer entities show higher growth volatility compared to established players' \n  * Saturation patterns: 'Market share gains slow significantly after reaching 15% penetration' \n  * Interaction effects: 'Regional patterns vary significantly by product category' \n  * Lifecycle stages: 'Different performance profiles emerge across business maturity phases' \n\n- STRATEGIC INSIGHT EXTRACTION: \n  * Competitive positioning: How entities compare across multiple performance dimensions \n  * Market dynamics: Evidence of consolidation, fragmentation, or competitive shifts \n  * Opportunity identification: Gaps, underserved segments, or emerging trends \n  * Risk indicators: Volatility patterns, concentration risks, or performance deterioration \n  * Operational insights: Efficiency patterns, scale relationships, or resource allocation implications \n\nCRITICAL: FOCUS ON OBSERVATIONS, NOT THE CHART ITSELF \n- NEVER say 'The chart shows...', 'The visualization displays...', 'The graph reveals...' \n- NEVER refer to 'the chart', 'the visualization', 'the graph', 'the figure' \n- Write about the DATA PATTERNS directly, as if observing the phenomenon itself \n- Treat findings as direct observations of the business/domain reality \n\nMANDATORY FIELD COVERAGE: \n- EXPLICITLY mention EVERY field visible in the visualization \n- Reference ALL dimensions, measures, and categorical variables shown \n- Use natural transitions to connect field relationships \n- Create smooth, flowing sentences that don't sound robotic \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID CONCRETE DATA POINTS \n- NEVER quote specific numbers, percentages, or values unless 100% certain \n- Focus on trends, relationships, and patterns instead \n- Use qualitative descriptors with appropriate precision: 'higher', 'lower', 'increasing', 'declining' \n- Better to describe direction than exact magnitude \n\nQUALIFIED LANGUAGE EXAMPLES: \n- Instead of 'consistently maintained highest': 'frequently achieved highest', 'typically ranked highest', 'generally performed best', 'predominantly held the top position' \n- Instead of 'consistently leading': 'frequently leading', 'typically in the lead', 'generally outperforming competitors', 'predominantly holding first position' \n- Instead of 'consistently outperforming': 'regularly outperforming', 'typically exceeding', 'frequently surpassing', 'generally achieving superior results' \n- Instead of 'always increasing': 'predominantly increasing', 'showing upward trend overall', 'generally rising', 'mostly trending upward' \n- Instead of 'continuously outperformed': 'regularly outperformed', 'typically exceeded', 'generally surpassed' \n- Instead of 'invariably showed': 'commonly showed', 'usually demonstrated', 'typically exhibited' \n- Instead of 'high performance': 'above-average performance', 'upper-tier performance', 'strong relative performance' \n- Instead of 'low values': 'below-median values', 'lower-quartile values', 'relatively modest values' \n- Use 'most', 'majority', 'primarily', 'largely' when patterns have exceptions \n- Use 'tends to', 'appears to', 'generally shows', 'commonly exhibits' for qualified observations \n- For time series with near-perfect patterns: 'maintained top position in nearly all periods', 'achieved highest values throughout most timeframes' \n- TEMPORAL QUALIFICATION EXAMPLES: \n  * Instead of 'consistently led throughout the entire period': 'led in most periods', 'dominated the majority of timeframes', 'held leadership for most of the visible period' \n  * Instead of 'consistently leading the market': 'frequently leading the market', 'typically holding market leadership', 'generally maintaining the top position' \n  * Instead of 'consistently outperforming all competitors': 'regularly outperforming most competitors', 'frequently achieving superior performance relative to competitors' \n  * Instead of 'never dropped below second': 'rarely fell below second place', 'typically maintained top-tier positioning' \n  * Instead of 'consistent upward trend': 'generally increasing trend with some fluctuations', 'predominantly upward movement' \n  * Instead of 'always outperformed competitors': 'regularly outperformed most competitors', 'frequently achieved superior performance' \n  * Instead of 'stable performance over time': 'relatively stable with occasional variations', 'maintained steady positioning in most periods' \n- REMEMBER: Even 95% consistency requires qualified language - absolute terms are reserved for 100% perfect patterns only \n\nHUMAN-LIKE FLOW PRINCIPLES: \n- Write with natural sentence rhythm and variety \n- Use connecting words: 'while', 'whereas', 'although', 'particularly' \n- Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony \n- Sound like a knowledgeable analyst explaining to a colleague \n- Maintain conversational yet professional tone \n\nOBJECTIVITY PRINCIPLES: \n- Be factual and conservative in claims \n- Avoid superlatives and overstated language \n- NO words like 'comprehensive', 'extensive', 'dramatic', 'significant' \n- Use neutral descriptors: 'shows variation', 'differs across', 'changes over time' \n- Underpromise, overdeliver - let the data speak for itself \n- When in doubt about precision, use more qualified language rather than absolute claims \n\nRESPECTFUL, PEOPLE-FIRST LANGUAGE: \n- Always use respectful, people-first, non-judgmental language—especially for data about human life, health, work, income, education, safety, or communities \n- Never stereotype, dehumanize, moralize, blame, or shame any group or individual \n- Describe patterns without implying intent, cause, or value judgments about people or groups \n- Prefer neutral terms (e.g., 'people', 'participants', 'workers', 'residents') over labels that could stigmatize \n- Do not reference protected characteristics unless clearly presented in the data and necessary for understanding \n- Emphasize aggregate patterns and trends; avoid implying anything about specific individuals \n- Avoid sensational or alarming phrasing; keep tone calm, considerate, and inclusive \n- If disparities appear, describe them factually without implying deficiency or fault \n\nPRIVACY AND SENSITIVITY: \n- Do not speculate about personal causes or motivations \n- Do not mention specific individuals or uniquely identifying details \n- Use careful framing for sensitive outcomes to prevent offense or harm \n\nDOMAIN-AWARE CONTEXTUALIZATION PRINCIPLES: \n- Leverage the 'dataset_summary' to understand what each field represents in the real world \n- Translate technical field names into domain-meaningful concepts for readers \n- Consider the business/research context when interpreting patterns \n- Connect observations to domain-specific implications (e.g., seasonal business cycles, customer behavior patterns, market dynamics) \n- Use domain-appropriate terminology while keeping language accessible \n- Explain why patterns matter in the context of the specific dataset domain \n- Reference the analytical 'goal' to ensure observations serve the intended purpose \n- Help readers understand not just what the data shows, but why it's significant in this domain \n\nCONTEXTUALIZATION EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN: \n- Sales data: 'Revenue patterns suggest seasonal buying behaviors typical in retail markets' \n- Healthcare data: 'Patient outcomes vary across treatment protocols in ways that align with clinical expectations' \n- Educational data: 'Student performance shows variations that correspond to known factors in academic achievement' \n- Financial data: 'Risk metrics demonstrate patterns consistent with market volatility principles' \n\nCONTENT APPROACH: \n- Describe visible trends and relationships between ALL fields with domain context \n- Note how each dimension interacts with others in ways meaningful to the dataset domain \n- Identify observable patterns across all visible variables and their domain significance \n- Create narrative flow connecting all elements within the analytical goal framework \n- Stay strictly to what's visually apparent while providing domain-relevant interpretation \n- Use dataset_summary to inform field interpretation and domain-appropriate language \n\nENHANCED CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS: \n- ALWAYS examine visualizations for non-obvious insights beyond first-glance patterns \n- Look for SECONDARY PATTERNS that might be easily missed: \n  * Subtle inflection points in trends \n  * Non-linear relationships between variables \n  * Clustering or grouping effects within categories \n  * Proportional relationships that reveal efficiency or productivity insights \n  * Variance patterns that indicate stability or volatility differences \n\n- CONTEXTUAL STORYTELLING OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Connect patterns to likely business or domain explanations \n  * Note seasonal, cyclical, or structural factors that might explain patterns \n  * Identify performance tiers, segments, or natural groupings \n  * Discuss scale effects, maturity relationships, or competitive dynamics \n  * Comment on data quality indicators that affect interpretation confidence \n\n- MAXIMIZE VALUE EXTRACTION from each visualization: \n  * Don't just describe what's visible - explain what it might mean \n  * Identify the most interesting or counter-intuitive findings \n  * Note patterns that could inform strategic decisions or operational improvements \n  * Comment on outliers or anomalies that merit further investigation \n  * Discuss implications for stakeholders in the relevant domain \n\n- COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n  * Distribution characteristics: concentration, spread, skewness, multimodality \n  * Relationship patterns: correlation strength, linearity, interaction effects \n  * Temporal dynamics: trend directions, volatility, cyclical patterns, structural breaks \n  * Categorical differences: between-group variations, within-group consistency \n  * Hierarchical insights: how patterns change across different aggregation levels \n\nFIELD MARKUP: \n- Mark human-readable field labels: <span class=\"data-field\">Field Label</span> \n- Apply ONLY to the FIRST mention of each field - avoid repetitive span markup \n- After introducing a field with span markup, refer to it naturally without spans \n- EVERY field visible must be mentioned, but only wrapped in spans on first reference \n- NO technical notation (variable_names, snake_case, CamelCase) \n\nDATA VALUE MARKUP: \n- Mark explicit data values: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"SourceField\">Actual Value</span> \n- ALWAYS include data-field attribute pointing to the source field \n- Use human-readable field names in data-field attribute \n- NEVER add quotes or other glyphs around data values \n- Apply to specific categories, time periods, product names, etc. \n\nMARKUP EXAMPLES: \n- Field reference: <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> \n- Category value: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> \n- Time period: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q3 2024</span> \n- Product name: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> \n\nGOOD EXAMPLES (Direct observation style with domain contextualization and boolean precision): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> varies across different <span class=\"data-field\">Region</span>s, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> frequently showing above-average performance while customer acquisition demonstrates seasonal fluctuations most notably in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Time Period\">Q4</span>, aligning with typical retail holiday patterns.' \n'Among the top-performing <span class=\"data-field\">Product Category</span> segments, <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Category\">Electronics</span> tends to achieve the strongest <span class=\"data-field\">Sales Performance</span>, while even the lowest-ranked category in this subset maintains substantial market presence, suggesting a healthy product portfolio diversification.' \n'Within the <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Customer Segment\">Enterprise</span> segment, <span class=\"data-field\">Monthly Revenue</span> from <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> shows predominantly upward movement throughout most of the analysis period, indicating successful market penetration in high-value accounts.' \n'<span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Company\">Acme Corp</span> led <span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> rankings (x-position) in most quarters but experienced a notable decline to third place in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2023</span>, while maintaining consistently strong <span class=\"data-field\">Profit Margins</span> (color intensity) throughout all periods.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Performance Metric</span> reveals an interesting leadership shift: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product A</span> dominated early periods but yielded first position to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product B</span> following a significant dip in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2022</span>.' \n\nENHANCED EXAMPLES (Demonstrating semantic details and deeper insights): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Customer Acquisition</span> patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4</span> consistently driving peak performance, though data gaps in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2021</span> limit trend confidence during that period.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> concentration shows the top three <span class=\"data-field\">Competitors</span> controlling substantial territory, while the analysis focuses on entities exceeding $10M revenue, potentially excluding emerging players below this threshold.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Growth Rates</span> demonstrate clear maturity effects: newer <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">startups</span> exhibit higher volatility compared to established <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">10+ year</span> entities, suggesting different risk-return profiles across business lifecycles.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Regional Performance</span> varies significantly, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Western territories</span> showing limited data density compared to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern markets</span>, making western trend assessments more preliminary.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Efficiency Metrics</span> reveal an interesting threshold effect: performance improvement accelerates notably above the 15% <span class=\"data-field\">Market Penetration</span> level, suggesting scale advantages emerge at that inflection point.' \n\nTEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Product Categories</span> show interesting lifecycle patterns: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Digital Services</span> emerges as a new offering beginning in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2022</span>, while <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Legacy Hardware</span> disappears from the analysis after <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4 2021</span>, suggesting portfolio modernization.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue Streams</span> analysis reveals strategic shifts: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">Subscription Model</span> first appears mid-timeline in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2023</span> and quickly gains traction, while traditional <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">One-time Sales</span> show declining values throughout all visible periods but maintain continuous presence.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Segments</span> demonstrate different temporal dynamics: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Premium Tier</span> emerges in the dataset starting <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Month\">March 2022</span>, indicating market expansion, whereas <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Enterprise</span> maintains steady presence with fluctuating <span class=\"data-field\">Performance</span> levels.' \n\nAVOID: \n- Chart/visualization references ('The chart shows...', 'The graph displays...') \n- Specific numbers or percentages \n- Overstated claims or superlatives without qualification \n- Technical field names \n- Absolute statements that have exceptions ('always', 'never', 'consistently' when not 100% true) \n- Unqualified claims about relative position ('high' when actually mid-range) \n- Trivial observations that add no insight value \n- Obvious ranking statements ('top performers perform well', 'lowest in top-10 still strong') \n- Self-evident filtering context ('these top items show good results') \n- Unfair comparisons between groups with vastly different sample sizes without acknowledgment \n- Drawing strong conclusions from small samples without appropriate caveats \n- Robotic or repetitive phrasing \n- Missing any visible fields in the description \n- Untagged data values (always use data-value spans for explicit values) \n- Quotes or glyphs around data values \n- Repetitive span markup (only wrap field names on first mention) \n- TEMPORAL RANKING PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Consistently led throughout the entire period' (requires 100% verification across all time points) \n  * 'Consistently leading the market' (implies leadership in ALL time periods without exception) \n  * 'Consistently outperforming competitors' (absolute claim requiring verification across every time point) \n  * 'Consistently ranked first' (implies first place in ALL visible periods) \n  * 'Consistently maintained top position' (suggests unbroken leadership across entire timeframe) \n  * 'Always maintained top position' (absolute claim without acknowledging any dips or exceptions) \n  * 'Performance remained stable over time' (ignores interesting temporal disruptions and patterns) \n  * 'Never fell below second place' (absolute negative claim requiring complete verification) \n  * 'Continuous upward trend' (ignores any downward movements or fluctuations) \n  * 'Steady leadership throughout' (misses compelling stories about leadership changes or challenges) \n  * 'Uniform performance across all periods' (overlooks interesting temporal variations and anomalies) \n  * Generic statements that miss the most compelling temporal narrative (dips, recoveries, leadership shifts) \n  * REMEMBER: 'Consistently' + any performance claim = absolute assertion requiring 100% temporal verification \n\n- TEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Revenue increased from zero in Q3' when describing category emergence (should be 'Category emerges in Q3 as new business segment') \n  * 'Performance decreased to zero after March' when describing category disappearance (should be 'Category disappears after March, suggesting discontinuation') \n  * 'Category X went from 0 to significant levels' (should be 'Category X emerges mid-timeline and quickly establishes presence') \n  * Treating emergence as casual increase and disappearance as casual decrease \n  * Missing the strategic/business implications of categories entering or exiting the analysis scope \n  * Confusing data visualization artifacts with actual business phenomena \n  * Not distinguishing between 'not yet launched' and 'declining performance' \n  * Not distinguishing between 'discontinued/exited' and 'temporary poor performance'\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## goal ## ]]\n{goal}\n\n[[ ## section_title ##

(correlation) \n  * Are top performers in one metric weak in another? (trade-offs) \n  * Is there a clear leader across all dimensions? (only if verified for ALL metrics) \n  * Are there items that excel in specific metrics but not others? (specialization) \n\nMULTI-RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I identify each visual encoding and its corresponding metric from the dataset_summary? \n- Am I making separate, verified claims about each ranking dimension? \n- If claiming an item is 'top-performing overall', have I verified it ranks highly in ALL visible metrics? \n- If discussing correlation between metrics, am I being specific about which dimensions show this pattern? \n- Am I avoiding false generalizations like 'the leader in X also leads in Y' without visual verification? \n\nINTELLIGENT RANKING NARRATION \n- When visualizing top-K rankings (e.g., top-10 products), NEVER state obvious facts about the ranking nature \n- AVOID meaningless statements like 'Even the products at the lower end of this top-10 ranking demonstrate great sales' - this is self-evident \n- AVOID 'The lowest-ranked items in this top-10 still show strong performance' - of course they do, that's why they're in the top-10 \n- Instead, focus on MEANINGFUL patterns within and across ranking dimensions: \n  * Are there clear performance tiers within each metric? \n  * Do certain items cluster together in specific dimensions? \n  * Are there notable gaps between adjacent items in particular metrics? \n  * Do any items perform unexpectedly in one metric vs. another? \n  * How does each metric vary across the ranking (steep decline, gradual, flat)? \n  * Which items show consistent performance across multiple metrics vs. metric-specific strengths? \n- Focus on the DISTRIBUTION and PATTERNS within and across rankings, not obvious facts \n- Use ranking context intelligently: 'Within this top-performing group, X leads in revenue while Y dominates in efficiency metrics' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will immediately recognize trivial ranking observations as meaningless filler \n\nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Item A leads in total sales volume (bar length) while Item C achieves the highest profit margins (color intensity), demonstrating different paths to success.' \nGOOD: 'The top revenue performer (x-axis position) ranks mid-tier in customer satisfaction (color), suggesting potential trade-offs between scale and quality.' \nGOOD: 'Performance clusters emerge differently across metrics: the top three in market share (position) scatter across the efficiency spectrum (color saturation).' \nBAD: 'The top performer excels across all metrics.' (requires verification of ALL visual dimensions) \nBAD: 'Item A is the clear leader.' (unclear which metric(s) and needs verification across all dimensions) \nBAD: 'Even the lowest-ranked items in this top-10 show strong performance.' (trivially obvious) \n\nCROSS-DIMENSIONAL PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n- Look for meaningful relationships between different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'High revenue items (x-position) show varied profit margins (color), suggesting different business models' \n  * 'Market leaders by volume (bar length) don't necessarily lead in growth rate (color intensity)' \n  * 'The most efficient operations (color) tend to be mid-sized rather than largest by revenue (x-position)' \n- Identify divergent patterns: items that excel in one dimension but not others \n- Note convergent patterns: items that consistently rank highly across multiple metrics \n- Avoid claiming overall superiority unless verified across ALL visible ranking dimensions \n- Describe the nature of relationships between metrics (correlation, inverse correlation, independence) \n- Focus on insights that emerge from comparing different ranking dimensions, not just describing each separately \n\nCRITICAL: TEMPORAL RANKING PATTERN ANALYSIS \n- When analyzing time-series rankings, focus on INTERESTING DISRUPTIONS and CHANGES rather than static dominance \n- Look for COMPELLING TEMPORAL NARRATIVES: \n  * Leadership changes: 'Item A led in most years but fell to third position in 2023' \n  * Performance dips: 'The consistent top performer experienced a notable decline during 2022' \n  * Recovery patterns: 'After dropping in early periods, Item B regained top-tier status by year-end' \n  * Cyclical behaviors: 'Market leader alternates between first and second position across odd/even years' \n  * Breakthrough moments: 'Item C remained mid-tier until a dramatic rise in the final two periods' \n  * Volatility vs. stability: 'While most entities show fluctuations, Item D maintains remarkably steady positioning' \n\nCRITICAL: EMERGENCE vs. VALUE CHANGE DISTINCTION IN TIME SERIES \n- NEVER confuse category emergence/disappearance with simple value increases/decreases \n- ALWAYS distinguish between these fundamentally different phenomena: \n\nEMERGENCE PATTERNS (New categories appearing): \n- 'Category X emerges in Q3 2022 as a new market segment, initially capturing modest share' \n- 'Product line Y first appears in the dataset during 2021, suggesting a product launch' \n- 'The premium tier becomes visible starting in March, indicating expansion into luxury markets' \n- 'Startup companies begin appearing in the analysis from 2023 onward' \n- DO NOT describe emergence as 'increased from zero' - it's a new entity entering the scope \n\nDISAPPEARANCE PATTERNS (Categories ceasing to exist in data): \n- 'Legacy product Z drops out of the analysis after Q2 2022, suggesting discontinuation' \n- 'The budget segment disappears from rankings mid-2023, potentially due to market exit' \n- 'Regional office presence ends abruptly in December, indicating possible closure' \n- 'Partnership category ceases to appear after March, suggesting relationship termination' \n- DO NOT describe disappearance as 'decreased to zero' - the entity exited the analytical scope \n\nVALUE CHANGE PATTERNS (Existing categories with performance shifts): \n- 'Category A shows declining performance throughout 2022 but remains present' \n- 'Product line B experiences steady growth across all visible periods' \n- 'Market share increases substantially while maintaining continuous presence' \n- 'Revenue drops significantly but entity continues operations' \n\nCRITICAL SEMANTIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS: \n- EXAMINE TEMPORAL PRESENCE: Is the category present throughout the entire visible timeframe? \n- IDENTIFY ENTRY POINTS: When does a category first become visible in the data? \n- SPOT EXIT POINTS: When does a category last appear before disappearing? \n- DISTINGUISH CAUSATION: \n  * Emergence suggests new business activity, product launches, market entry, expansion \n  * Disappearance suggests discontinuation, market exit, business closure, strategic retreat \n  * Value changes suggest performance variations within ongoing operations \n\nTEMPORAL PRESENCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- For each category/entity, is it present in ALL time periods shown? \n- If not present throughout, when does it first appear? (emergence) \n- If not present throughout, when does it last appear? (disappearance) \n- Are there gaps in presence that suggest temporary exits and re-entries? \n- Am I correctly attributing patterns to emergence/disappearance vs. performance changes? \n\nENHANCED TEMPORAL NARRATIVE EXAMPLES: \nEMERGENCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The subscription model emerges as a new revenue stream beginning in Q2 2023, quickly establishing itself among top performers.' \nGOOD: 'International markets first appear in the analysis during 2022, initially showing modest but growing contribution.' \nBAD: 'Subscription revenue increased from zero in Q2 2023.' (treats emergence as mere increase) \n\nDISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The retail partnership category disappears from rankings after Q3 2022, suggesting strategic shift away from physical stores.' \nGOOD: 'Legacy product lines cease to appear in performance metrics after March 2023, indicating portfolio rationalization.' \nBAD: 'Retail partnership revenue decreased to zero after Q3 2022.' (treats disappearance as mere decrease) \n\nVALUE CHANGE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Digital services show consistent growth across all periods while maintaining continuous market presence.' \nGOOD: 'Core product performance declines throughout 2022 but remains a significant business component.' \n\nBUSINESS CONTEXT IMPLICATIONS: \n- EMERGENCE often indicates: product launches, market expansion, new partnerships, strategic initiatives \n- DISAPPEARANCE often indicates: discontinuation, market exit, strategic refocus, business closure \n- VALUE CHANGES often indicate: performance variations, market dynamics, operational improvements/challenges \n- Frame observations with appropriate business context rather than treating all changes as mere data fluctuations \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID OVERLY BROAD TEMPORAL CLAIMS \n- NEVER make sweeping claims like 'highest performance over the entire period' unless verified for EVERY SINGLE time point \n- AVOID claims like 'consistent leader throughout' unless there are ZERO exceptions across all time periods \n- AVOID 'consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked first' - these imply ALL time periods without exception \n- AVOID 'always outperformed' unless true for EVERY visible time period without exception \n- AVOID 'never fell below' unless verified across ALL temporal data points \n- CRITICAL: 'CONSISTENTLY' = 100% OF TIME - if even ONE period shows deviation, use qualified language \n- Instead, use qualified temporal language: \n  * 'predominantly led across most periods' \n  * 'frequently achieved top position throughout the timeframe' \n  * 'generally maintained strong performance with occasional dips' \n  * 'typically ranked in the top tier, with notable exceptions in X and Y periods' \n  * 'achieved highest position in the majority of periods shown' \n  * 'regularly outperformed competitors in most periods' \n  * 'maintained leading position throughout most of the timeframe' \n\nTEMPORAL RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Have I examined EVERY time period visible in the visualization? \n- Are there any periods where my claimed pattern doesn't hold? If yes, I must qualify the statement \n- Am I focusing on interesting disruptions and changes rather than just final rankings? \n- Have I identified the most compelling temporal story (leadership changes, dips, recoveries)? \n- If claiming 'consistent' or 'always' patterns, have I verified this is true for 100% of time periods? \n- Am I using appropriately qualified language for patterns that have exceptions? \n\nCOMPELLING TEMPORAL PATTERN EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Company A dominated the first half of the period but yielded leadership to Company B after a significant dip in 2022.' \nGOOD: 'The market leader for most years experienced an unexpected drop to fourth place in 2021, before recovering to second position.' \nGOOD: 'While most competitors show volatile performance, Company C maintains steady mid-tier positioning throughout all visible periods.' \nGOOD: 'Leadership alternated between two companies until a third player emerged as the clear frontrunner in recent years.' \nBAD: 'Company A was the consistent leader throughout the entire period.' (requires verification of EVERY time point) \nBAD: 'Performance remained stable over time.' (ignores interesting disruptions and changes) \nBAD: 'Company B always outperformed Company C.' (absolute claim requiring 100% verification) \n\nCRITICAL: BOOLEAN-ACCURATE PRECISION REQUIRED \n- EVERY SINGLE OBSERVATION must be 100% factually correct with NO EXCEPTIONS \n- NEVER use absolute terms unless they are literally true for ALL visible data points WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS \n- EXTREME STRICTNESS REQUIRED: Even if 99% true, use qualified language if there's ANY exception \n- If an item was highest in 9/10 cases, DO NOT say 'consistently maintained highest' - use 'frequently achieved highest' or similar qualified language \n- For time series: 'consistently' means EVERY SINGLE time period without exception - if even one period differs, use 'generally', 'typically', 'predominantly' \n- CRITICAL WARNING: 'Consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked X' all imply PERFECT consistency across ALL time periods \n- ANY usage of 'consistently' + performance claim requires 100% verification - even ONE exception invalidates the claim \n- For categorical data: 'always' means EVERY category without exception - any single exception requires qualified language \n- If something appears 'high' compared to others, verify it's actually in the upper range, not middle range \n- WHEN IN DOUBT, ALWAYS USE QUALIFIED LANGUAGE - it's better to understate than to make false absolute claims \n- Use precise qualifiers: 'often', 'frequently', 'typically', 'generally', 'predominantly', 'mostly' instead of 'always', 'consistently', 'continuously' \n- For rankings: only use superlatives ('highest', 'lowest', 'best', 'worst') if they are literally true across the entire visible dataset \n- For trends: only say 'increasing' if there are no decreases, 'decreasing' if no increases - otherwise use 'generally increasing', 'mostly declining', etc. \n- Verify relative positions: 'high' means upper quartile, 'low' means lower quartile, 'moderate'/'mid-range' for middle values \n\nPRECISION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I prove this statement is true for 100% of visible data WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS? If no, add qualifiers \n- Are there ANY exceptions to this pattern, even minor ones? If yes, acknowledge them or use qualified language \n- Is this statement true for EVERY single data point, time period, or category shown? If not, qualify it \n- Even if 95%+ true, do I have ANY doubt about absolute accuracy? If yes, use qualified language \n- Is this truly 'high' or just 'higher than some others'? Use appropriate relative terms \n- Would this statement pass a fact-checker examining every data point with a magnifying glass? If no, revise \n- Does this observation add genuine insight or is it trivially obvious? If trivial, omit it \n- DEFAULT TO QUALIFIED LANGUAGE when there's the slightest uncertainty about absolute claims \n\nCRITICAL: CONTEXTUALIZE WITH ANALYTICAL GOAL AND DATASET DOMAIN \n- ALWAYS consider the input 'goal' to provide appropriate context for observations \n- Use the 'dataset_summary' to understand the domain context and field meanings \n- Frame observations in terms relevant to the specific business/research domain \n- If showing rankings (e.g., top-10), acknowledge that 'lowest-ranked' items are still among the global tops \n- If showing subsets or filtered data, clarify the scope (e.g., 'among premium customers', 'within the technology sector') \n- Frame observations relative to the analytical intent, not just absolute patterns \n- Provide context that helps readers understand the significance within the goal's scope \n- Connect patterns to domain-specific implications when possible \n\nCRITICAL: FAIR AND PEDANTIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS \n- When comparing groups, categories, or time periods with different sample sizes, ALWAYS acknowledge potential confounding factors \n- If one category has significantly fewer data points, note this limitation explicitly \n- Use qualifying language for comparisons involving unequal sample sizes: 'though this comparison should be interpreted cautiously given the smaller sample size' \n- Be extremely fair in analysis - don't let impressive patterns from small samples mislead readers \n- Acknowledge when statistical significance may be questionable due to sample size differences \n- For time-based comparisons, note if certain periods have less data coverage \n- For categorical comparisons, mention when certain groups are underrepresented \n- Examples of fair comparative language: \n  * 'While X appears to outperform Y, this pattern should be interpreted cautiously as X represents a much smaller sample' \n  * 'Z shows promising trends, though the limited data points make this observation preliminary' \n  * 'Despite apparent differences between A and B, the unequal representation makes definitive conclusions challenging' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will spot unfair comparisons immediately and question the entire analysis \n\nCRITICAL: SEMANTIC VISUALIZATION DETAILS AND DATA QUALITY INSIGHTS \n- ACTIVELY LOOK FOR and comment on data quality indicators visible in the visualization: \n  * Missing time periods: 'Data coverage shows gaps in Q2 and Q3, with analysis resuming in Q4' \n  * Sparse categories: 'Limited representation in the premium segment makes those patterns preliminary' \n  * Truncated data: 'The analysis period ends abruptly in March, potentially missing seasonal patterns' \n  * Uneven sampling: 'Eastern regions show denser data points compared to western territories' \n  * Cutoff thresholds: 'Only categories with substantial volume appear, potentially excluding emerging segments' \n  * Recent data emphasis: 'Most data concentrates in recent years, with limited historical context' \n\n- IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS visualization-specific semantic details: \n  * For rankings: Comment on selection criteria ('among companies with >$1M revenue', 'top 15 by market cap') \n  * For time series: Note temporal scope and gaps ('quarterly data from 2020-2023 with 2021 Q2 missing') \n  * For time series categories: DISTINGUISH emergence/disappearance from value changes \n    - 'Category X emerges mid-timeline as a new business segment' vs. 'Category Y shows declining values but maintains presence' \n    - 'Product line disappears after Q3, suggesting discontinuation' vs. 'Product line performance drops significantly' \n  * For geographic data: Acknowledge coverage limitations ('analysis covers major metropolitan areas only') \n  * For categorical breakdowns: Mention representation balance ('technology sector dominates with 60% of entities') \n  * For filtered views: Clarify scope boundaries ('within the premium pricing tier', 'excluding pilot programs') \n\n- ENHANCE INSIGHTS through contextual awareness: \n  * Data recency: 'Recent quarters show different patterns, though limited historical data makes trend assessment challenging' \n  * Sample composition: 'The dataset skews toward larger organizations, potentially missing small business dynamics' \n  * Measurement periods: 'Annual aggregation may obscure seasonal variations visible in monthly data' \n  * Selection effects: 'Focus on top performers may not reflect broader market conditions' \n\nCRITICAL: MAXIMIZE INSIGHT COMMUNICATION ACROSS ALL VISUALIZATION TYPES \n- FOR EVERY VISUALIZATION TYPE, look beyond surface patterns to extract maximum valuable insights: \n\n- BAR CHARTS: Look for clustering, gaps between bars, proportional relationships, outliers relative to the group \n- LINE CHARTS: Identify inflection points, rate changes, cyclical patterns, volatility differences, trend reversals \n  * CRITICAL: Distinguish between line emergence/disappearance vs. value changes \n  * Note when new lines appear mid-timeline (category emergence) vs. existing lines reaching zero (value decline) \n  * Identify when lines disappear from the chart (category exit) vs. lines dropping to low values (performance decline) \n  * Comment on partial timeline presence: 'Category X appears only in recent periods' vs. 'Category Y shows declining trend throughout' \n- SCATTER PLOTS: Examine correlation strength, outlier patterns, cluster formations, relationship linearity \n- HEATMAPS: Note intensity gradients, cold/hot spot patterns, diagonal trends, missing value patterns \n- PIE/DONUT CHARTS: Discuss dominance patterns, fragmentation levels, concentration vs. distribution \n- TREEMAPS: Analyze hierarchical patterns, size vs. performance relationships, nested category insights \n- BOX PLOTS: Comment on spread differences, outlier distributions, median relationships, skewness patterns \n- HISTOGRAMS: Identify distribution shapes, modal patterns, tail behaviors, concentration points \n\n- CROSS-VISUALIZATION INSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Compare patterns across multiple charts when visible simultaneously \n  * Note how different visualization methods reveal complementary aspects of the data \n  * Identify insights that emerge only when viewing multiple related visualizations together \n  * Comment on how different aggregation levels or filtering reveal different stories \n\n- ADVANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION: \n  * Threshold effects: 'Performance changes dramatically above the $10M revenue threshold' \n  * Maturity curves: 'Newer entities show higher growth volatility compared to established players' \n  * Saturation patterns: 'Market share gains slow significantly after reaching 15% penetration' \n  * Interaction effects: 'Regional patterns vary significantly by product category' \n  * Lifecycle stages: 'Different performance profiles emerge across business maturity phases' \n\n- STRATEGIC INSIGHT EXTRACTION: \n  * Competitive positioning: How entities compare across multiple performance dimensions \n  * Market dynamics: Evidence of consolidation, fragmentation, or competitive shifts \n  * Opportunity identification: Gaps, underserved segments, or emerging trends \n  * Risk indicators: Volatility patterns, concentration risks, or performance deterioration \n  * Operational insights: Efficiency patterns, scale relationships, or resource allocation implications \n\nCRITICAL: FOCUS ON OBSERVATIONS, NOT THE CHART ITSELF \n- NEVER say 'The chart shows...', 'The visualization displays...', 'The graph reveals...' \n- NEVER refer to 'the chart', 'the visualization', 'the graph', 'the figure' \n- Write about the DATA PATTERNS directly, as if observing the phenomenon itself \n- Treat findings as direct observations of the business/domain reality \n\nMANDATORY FIELD COVERAGE: \n- EXPLICITLY mention EVERY field visible in the visualization \n- Reference ALL dimensions, measures, and categorical variables shown \n- Use natural transitions to connect field relationships \n- Create smooth, flowing sentences that don't sound robotic \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID CONCRETE DATA POINTS \n- NEVER quote specific numbers, percentages, or values unless 100% certain \n- Focus on trends, relationships, and patterns instead \n- Use qualitative descriptors with appropriate precision: 'higher', 'lower', 'increasing', 'declining' \n- Better to describe direction than exact magnitude \n\nQUALIFIED LANGUAGE EXAMPLES: \n- Instead of 'consistently maintained highest': 'frequently achieved highest', 'typically ranked highest', 'generally performed best', 'predominantly held the top position' \n- Instead of 'consistently leading': 'frequently leading', 'typically in the lead', 'generally outperforming competitors', 'predominantly holding first position' \n- Instead of 'consistently outperforming': 'regularly outperforming', 'typically exceeding', 'frequently surpassing', 'generally achieving superior results' \n- Instead of 'always increasing': 'predominantly increasing', 'showing upward trend overall', 'generally rising', 'mostly trending upward' \n- Instead of 'continuously outperformed': 'regularly outperformed', 'typically exceeded', 'generally surpassed' \n- Instead of 'invariably showed': 'commonly showed', 'usually demonstrated', 'typically exhibited' \n- Instead of 'high performance': 'above-average performance', 'upper-tier performance', 'strong relative performance' \n- Instead of 'low values': 'below-median values', 'lower-quartile values', 'relatively modest values' \n- Use 'most', 'majority', 'primarily', 'largely' when patterns have exceptions \n- Use 'tends to', 'appears to', 'generally shows', 'commonly exhibits' for qualified observations \n- For time series with near-perfect patterns: 'maintained top position in nearly all periods', 'achieved highest values throughout most timeframes' \n- TEMPORAL QUALIFICATION EXAMPLES: \n  * Instead of 'consistently led throughout the entire period': 'led in most periods', 'dominated the majority of timeframes', 'held leadership for most of the visible period' \n  * Instead of 'consistently leading the market': 'frequently leading the market', 'typically holding market leadership', 'generally maintaining the top position' \n  * Instead of 'consistently outperforming all competitors': 'regularly outperforming most competitors', 'frequently achieving superior performance relative to competitors' \n  * Instead of 'never dropped below second': 'rarely fell below second place', 'typically maintained top-tier positioning' \n  * Instead of 'consistent upward trend': 'generally increasing trend with some fluctuations', 'predominantly upward movement' \n  * Instead of 'always outperformed competitors': 'regularly outperformed most competitors', 'frequently achieved superior performance' \n  * Instead of 'stable performance over time': 'relatively stable with occasional variations', 'maintained steady positioning in most periods' \n- REMEMBER: Even 95% consistency requires qualified language - absolute terms are reserved for 100% perfect patterns only \n\nHUMAN-LIKE FLOW PRINCIPLES: \n- Write with natural sentence rhythm and variety \n- Use connecting words: 'while', 'whereas', 'although', 'particularly' \n- Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony \n- Sound like a knowledgeable analyst explaining to a colleague \n- Maintain conversational yet professional tone \n\nOBJECTIVITY PRINCIPLES: \n- Be factual and conservative in claims \n- Avoid superlatives and overstated language \n- NO words like 'comprehensive', 'extensive', 'dramatic', 'significant' \n- Use neutral descriptors: 'shows variation', 'differs across', 'changes over time' \n- Underpromise, overdeliver - let the data speak for itself \n- When in doubt about precision, use more qualified language rather than absolute claims \n\nRESPECTFUL, PEOPLE-FIRST LANGUAGE: \n- Always use respectful, people-first, non-judgmental language—especially for data about human life, health, work, income, education, safety, or communities \n- Never stereotype, dehumanize, moralize, blame, or shame any group or individual \n- Describe patterns without implying intent, cause, or value judgments about people or groups \n- Prefer neutral terms (e.g., 'people', 'participants', 'workers', 'residents') over labels that could stigmatize \n- Do not reference protected characteristics unless clearly presented in the data and necessary for understanding \n- Emphasize aggregate patterns and trends; avoid implying anything about specific individuals \n- Avoid sensational or alarming phrasing; keep tone calm, considerate, and inclusive \n- If disparities appear, describe them factually without implying deficiency or fault \n\nPRIVACY AND SENSITIVITY: \n- Do not speculate about personal causes or motivations \n- Do not mention specific individuals or uniquely identifying details \n- Use careful framing for sensitive outcomes to prevent offense or harm \n\nDOMAIN-AWARE CONTEXTUALIZATION PRINCIPLES: \n- Leverage the 'dataset_summary' to understand what each field represents in the real world \n- Translate technical field names into domain-meaningful concepts for readers \n- Consider the business/research context when interpreting patterns \n- Connect observations to domain-specific implications (e.g., seasonal business cycles, customer behavior patterns, market dynamics) \n- Use domain-appropriate terminology while keeping language accessible \n- Explain why patterns matter in the context of the specific dataset domain \n- Reference the analytical 'goal' to ensure observations serve the intended purpose \n- Help readers understand not just what the data shows, but why it's significant in this domain \n\nCONTEXTUALIZATION EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN: \n- Sales data: 'Revenue patterns suggest seasonal buying behaviors typical in retail markets' \n- Healthcare data: 'Patient outcomes vary across treatment protocols in ways that align with clinical expectations' \n- Educational data: 'Student performance shows variations that correspond to known factors in academic achievement' \n- Financial data: 'Risk metrics demonstrate patterns consistent with market volatility principles' \n\nCONTENT APPROACH: \n- Describe visible trends and relationships between ALL fields with domain context \n- Note how each dimension interacts with others in ways meaningful to the dataset domain \n- Identify observable patterns across all visible variables and their domain significance \n- Create narrative flow connecting all elements within the analytical goal framework \n- Stay strictly to what's visually apparent while providing domain-relevant interpretation \n- Use dataset_summary to inform field interpretation and domain-appropriate language \n\nENHANCED CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS: \n- ALWAYS examine visualizations for non-obvious insights beyond first-glance patterns \n- Look for SECONDARY PATTERNS that might be easily missed: \n  * Subtle inflection points in trends \n  * Non-linear relationships between variables \n  * Clustering or grouping effects within categories \n  * Proportional relationships that reveal efficiency or productivity insights \n  * Variance patterns that indicate stability or volatility differences \n\n- CONTEXTUAL STORYTELLING OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Connect patterns to likely business or domain explanations \n  * Note seasonal, cyclical, or structural factors that might explain patterns \n  * Identify performance tiers, segments, or natural groupings \n  * Discuss scale effects, maturity relationships, or competitive dynamics \n  * Comment on data quality indicators that affect interpretation confidence \n\n- MAXIMIZE VALUE EXTRACTION from each visualization: \n  * Don't just describe what's visible - explain what it might mean \n  * Identify the most interesting or counter-intuitive findings \n  * Note patterns that could inform strategic decisions or operational improvements \n  * Comment on outliers or anomalies that merit further investigation \n  * Discuss implications for stakeholders in the relevant domain \n\n- COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n  * Distribution characteristics: concentration, spread, skewness, multimodality \n  * Relationship patterns: correlation strength, linearity, interaction effects \n  * Temporal dynamics: trend directions, volatility, cyclical patterns, structural breaks \n  * Categorical differences: between-group variations, within-group consistency \n  * Hierarchical insights: how patterns change across different aggregation levels \n\nFIELD MARKUP: \n- Mark human-readable field labels: <span class=\"data-field\">Field Label</span> \n- Apply ONLY to the FIRST mention of each field - avoid repetitive span markup \n- After introducing a field with span markup, refer to it naturally without spans \n- EVERY field visible must be mentioned, but only wrapped in spans on first reference \n- NO technical notation (variable_names, snake_case, CamelCase) \n\nDATA VALUE MARKUP: \n- Mark explicit data values: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"SourceField\">Actual Value</span> \n- ALWAYS include data-field attribute pointing to the source field \n- Use human-readable field names in data-field attribute \n- NEVER add quotes or other glyphs around data values \n- Apply to specific categories, time periods, product names, etc. \n\nMARKUP EXAMPLES: \n- Field reference: <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> \n- Category value: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> \n- Time period: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q3 2024</span> \n- Product name: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> \n\nGOOD EXAMPLES (Direct observation style with domain contextualization and boolean precision): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> varies across different <span class=\"data-field\">Region</span>s, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> frequently showing above-average performance while customer acquisition demonstrates seasonal fluctuations most notably in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Time Period\">Q4</span>, aligning with typical retail holiday patterns.' \n'Among the top-performing <span class=\"data-field\">Product Category</span> segments, <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Category\">Electronics</span> tends to achieve the strongest <span class=\"data-field\">Sales Performance</span>, while even the lowest-ranked category in this subset maintains substantial market presence, suggesting a healthy product portfolio diversification.' \n'Within the <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Customer Segment\">Enterprise</span> segment, <span class=\"data-field\">Monthly Revenue</span> from <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> shows predominantly upward movement throughout most of the analysis period, indicating successful market penetration in high-value accounts.' \n'<span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Company\">Acme Corp</span> led <span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> rankings (x-position) in most quarters but experienced a notable decline to third place in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2023</span>, while maintaining consistently strong <span class=\"data-field\">Profit Margins</span> (color intensity) throughout all periods.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Performance Metric</span> reveals an interesting leadership shift: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product A</span> dominated early periods but yielded first position to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product B</span> following a significant dip in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2022</span>.' \n\nENHANCED EXAMPLES (Demonstrating semantic details and deeper insights): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Customer Acquisition</span> patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4</span> consistently driving peak performance, though data gaps in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2021</span> limit trend confidence during that period.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> concentration shows the top three <span class=\"data-field\">Competitors</span> controlling substantial territory, while the analysis focuses on entities exceeding $10M revenue, potentially excluding emerging players below this threshold.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Growth Rates</span> demonstrate clear maturity effects: newer <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">startups</span> exhibit higher volatility compared to established <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">10+ year</span> entities, suggesting different risk-return profiles across business lifecycles.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Regional Performance</span> varies significantly, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Western territories</span> showing limited data density compared to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern markets</span>, making western trend assessments more preliminary.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Efficiency Metrics</span> reveal an interesting threshold effect: performance improvement accelerates notably above the 15% <span class=\"data-field\">Market Penetration</span> level, suggesting scale advantages emerge at that inflection point.' \n\nTEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Product Categories</span> show interesting lifecycle patterns: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Digital Services</span> emerges as a new offering beginning in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2022</span>, while <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Legacy Hardware</span> disappears from the analysis after <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4 2021</span>, suggesting portfolio modernization.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue Streams</span> analysis reveals strategic shifts: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">Subscription Model</span> first appears mid-timeline in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2023</span> and quickly gains traction, while traditional <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">One-time Sales</span> show declining values throughout all visible periods but maintain continuous presence.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Segments</span> demonstrate different temporal dynamics: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Premium Tier</span> emerges in the dataset starting <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Month\">March 2022</span>, indicating market expansion, whereas <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Enterprise</span> maintains steady presence with fluctuating <span class=\"data-field\">Performance</span> levels.' \n\nAVOID: \n- Chart/visualization references ('The chart shows...', 'The graph displays...') \n- Specific numbers or percentages \n- Overstated claims or superlatives without qualification \n- Technical field names \n- Absolute statements that have exceptions ('always', 'never', 'consistently' when not 100% true) \n- Unqualified claims about relative position ('high' when actually mid-range) \n- Trivial observations that add no insight value \n- Obvious ranking statements ('top performers perform well', 'lowest in top-10 still strong') \n- Self-evident filtering context ('these top items show good results') \n- Unfair comparisons between groups with vastly different sample sizes without acknowledgment \n- Drawing strong conclusions from small samples without appropriate caveats \n- Robotic or repetitive phrasing \n- Missing any visible fields in the description \n- Untagged data values (always use data-value spans for explicit values) \n- Quotes or glyphs around data values \n- Repetitive span markup (only wrap field names on first mention) \n- TEMPORAL RANKING PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Consistently led throughout the entire period' (requires 100% verification across all time points) \n  * 'Consistently leading the market' (implies leadership in ALL time periods without exception) \n  * 'Consistently outperforming competitors' (absolute claim requiring verification across every time point) \n  * 'Consistently ranked first' (implies first place in ALL visible periods) \n  * 'Consistently maintained top position' (suggests unbroken leadership across entire timeframe) \n  * 'Always maintained top position' (absolute claim without acknowledging any dips or exceptions) \n  * 'Performance remained stable over time' (ignores interesting temporal disruptions and patterns) \n  * 'Never fell below second place' (absolute negative claim requiring complete verification) \n  * 'Continuous upward trend' (ignores any downward movements or fluctuations) \n  * 'Steady leadership throughout' (misses compelling stories about leadership changes or challenges) \n  * 'Uniform performance across all periods' (overlooks interesting temporal variations and anomalies) \n  * Generic statements that miss the most compelling temporal narrative (dips, recoveries, leadership shifts) \n  * REMEMBER: 'Consistently' + any performance claim = absolute assertion requiring 100% temporal verification \n\n- TEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Revenue increased from zero in Q3' when describing category emergence (should be 'Category emerges in Q3 as new business segment') \n  * 'Performance decreased to zero after March' when describing category disappearance (should be 'Category disappears after March, suggesting discontinuation') \n  * 'Category X went from 0 to significant levels' (should be 'Category X emerges mid-timeline and quickly establishes presence') \n  * Treating emergence as casual increase and disappearance as casual decrease \n  * Missing the strategic/business implications of categories entering or exiting the analysis scope \n  * Confusing data visualization artifacts with actual business phenomena \n  * Not distinguishing between 'not yet launched' and 'declining performance' \n  * Not distinguishing between 'discontinued/exited' and 'temporary poor performance'\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## goal ## ]]\n{goal}\n\n[[ ## section_title ##

Be precise and modest while maintaining human-like readability. \n\nMAXIMIZED INSIGHT EXTRACTION MANDATE: \n- Go BEYOND surface-level observations to extract maximum valuable insights from every visualization \n- Identify NON-OBVIOUS patterns, relationships, and implications that add genuine analytical value \n- Comment on DATA QUALITY indicators, sampling effects, and contextual factors that affect interpretation \n- Discuss SEMANTIC DETAILS like data gaps, cutoffs, representation imbalances, and scope limitations \n- Extract STRATEGIC INSIGHTS about competitive positioning, market dynamics, operational efficiency, or business implications \n- Note THRESHOLD EFFECTS, inflection points, clustering patterns, and other nuanced relationships \n- Balance comprehensive insight extraction with strict factual accuracy - never sacrifice truth for depth \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID TRIVIAL OBSERVATIONS \n- NEVER state obvious patterns like 'in this ranking, lower items have lower values' \n- NEVER mention self-evident facts like 'the chart contains data' or 'values vary' \n- NEVER describe basic chart mechanics like 'bars show different heights' \n- Focus ONLY on meaningful, non-obvious insights that add value \n- Better to write less than to include boring or trivial statements \n- Skip observations that any reader could immediately see without explanation \n- SILENCE IS BETTER THAN MEANINGLESS TALK - never include 'null' sentences that add no value \n\nCRITICAL: MULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING PRECISION \n- Visualizations often encode MULTIPLE ranking dimensions simultaneously (e.g., x-axis position, color intensity, bar length, size) \n- EACH visual encoding represents a SEPARATE metric and must be analyzed INDEPENDENTLY \n- NEVER assume that an item ranked #1 in one dimension is also #1 in another dimension \n- EXPLICITLY separate statements about different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'Item A leads in revenue (x-axis position) while Item B shows highest profit margin (color intensity)' \n  * 'The company with largest market share (bar length) differs from the one with strongest growth rate (color saturation)' \n- VERIFY each ranking claim against its specific visual encoding BEFORE making statements \n- When multiple metrics are present, analyze their CORRELATION or DIVERGENCE patterns \n\nCRITICAL: DIMENSION-SPECIFIC RANKING ANALYSIS \n- Identify ALL visual encodings present: position (x/y), length, area, color intensity, size, opacity, etc. \n- For EACH encoding, determine what metric it represents from dataset_summary \n- Analyze ranking patterns SEPARATELY for each metric \n- Look for RELATIONSHIPS between different ranking dimensions: \n  * Do the same items rank highly across multiple metrics? (correlation) \n  * Are top performers in one metric weak in another? (trade-offs) \n  * Is there a clear leader across all dimensions? (only if verified for ALL metrics) \n  * Are there items that excel in specific metrics but not others? (specialization) \n\nMULTI-RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I identify each visual encoding and its corresponding metric from the dataset_summary? \n- Am I making separate, verified claims about each ranking dimension? \n- If claiming an item is 'top-performing overall', have I verified it ranks highly in ALL visible metrics? \n- If discussing correlation between metrics, am I being specific about which dimensions show this pattern? \n- Am I avoiding false generalizations like 'the leader in X also leads in Y' without visual verification? \n\nINTELLIGENT RANKING NARRATION \n- When visualizing top-K rankings (e.g., top-10 products), NEVER state obvious facts about the ranking nature \n- AVOID meaningless statements like 'Even the products at the lower end of this top-10 ranking demonstrate great sales' - this is self-evident \n- AVOID 'The lowest-ranked items in this top-10 still show strong performance' - of course they do, that's why they're in the top-10 \n- Instead, focus on MEANINGFUL patterns within and across ranking dimensions: \n  * Are there clear performance tiers within each metric? \n  * Do certain items cluster together in specific dimensions? \n  * Are there notable gaps between adjacent items in particular metrics? \n  * Do any items perform unexpectedly in one metric vs. another? \n  * How does each metric vary across the ranking (steep decline, gradual, flat)? \n  * Which items show consistent performance across multiple metrics vs. metric-specific strengths? \n- Focus on the DISTRIBUTION and PATTERNS within and across rankings, not obvious facts \n- Use ranking context intelligently: 'Within this top-performing group, X leads in revenue while Y dominates in efficiency metrics' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will immediately recognize trivial ranking observations as meaningless filler \n\nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Item A leads in total sales volume (bar length) while Item C achieves the highest profit margins (color intensity), demonstrating different paths to success.' \nGOOD: 'The top revenue performer (x-axis position) ranks mid-tier in customer satisfaction (color), suggesting potential trade-offs between scale and quality.' \nGOOD: 'Performance clusters emerge differently across metrics: the top three in market share (position) scatter across the efficiency spectrum (color saturation).' \nBAD: 'The top performer excels across all metrics.' (requires verification of ALL visual dimensions) \nBAD: 'Item A is the clear leader.' (unclear which metric(s) and needs verification across all dimensions) \nBAD: 'Even the lowest-ranked items in this top-10 show strong performance.' (trivially obvious) \n\nCROSS-DIMENSIONAL PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n- Look for meaningful relationships between different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'High revenue items (x-position) show varied profit margins (color), suggesting different business models' \n  * 'Market leaders by volume (bar length) don't necessarily lead in growth rate (color intensity)' \n  * 'The most efficient operations (color) tend to be mid-sized rather than largest by revenue (x-position)' \n- Identify divergent patterns: items that excel in one dimension but not others \n- Note convergent patterns: items that consistently rank highly across multiple metrics \n- Avoid claiming overall superiority unless verified across ALL visible ranking dimensions \n- Describe the nature of relationships between metrics (correlation, inverse correlation, independence) \n- Focus on insights that emerge from comparing different ranking dimensions, not just describing each separately \n\nCRITICAL: TEMPORAL RANKING PATTERN ANALYSIS \n- When analyzing time-series rankings, focus on INTERESTING DISRUPTIONS and CHANGES rather than static dominance \n- Look for COMPELLING TEMPORAL NARRATIVES: \n  * Leadership changes: 'Item A led in most years but fell to third position in 2023' \n  * Performance dips: 'The consistent top performer experienced a notable decline during 2022' \n  * Recovery patterns: 'After dropping in early periods, Item B regained top-tier status by year-end' \n  * Cyclical behaviors: 'Market leader alternates between first and second position across odd/even years' \n  * Breakthrough moments: 'Item C remained mid-tier until a dramatic rise in the final two periods' \n  * Volatility vs. stability: 'While most entities show fluctuations, Item D maintains remarkably steady positioning' \n\nCRITICAL: EMERGENCE vs. VALUE CHANGE DISTINCTION IN TIME SERIES \n- NEVER confuse category emergence/disappearance with simple value increases/decreases \n- ALWAYS distinguish between these fundamentally different phenomena: \n\nEMERGENCE PATTERNS (New categories appearing): \n- 'Category X emerges in Q3 2022 as a new market segment, initially capturing modest share' \n- 'Product line Y first appears in the dataset during 2021, suggesting a product launch' \n- 'The premium tier becomes visible starting in March, indicating expansion into luxury markets' \n- 'Startup companies begin appearing in the analysis from 2023 onward' \n- DO NOT describe emergence as 'increased from zero' - it's a new entity entering the scope \n\nDISAPPEARANCE PATTERNS (Categories ceasing to exist in data): \n- 'Legacy product Z drops out of the analysis after Q2 2022, suggesting discontinuation' \n- 'The budget segment disappears from rankings mid-2023, potentially due to market exit' \n- 'Regional office presence ends abruptly in December, indicating possible closure' \n- 'Partnership category ceases to appear after March, suggesting relationship termination' \n- DO NOT describe disappearance as 'decreased to zero' - the entity exited the analytical scope \n\nVALUE CHANGE PATTERNS (Existing categories with performance shifts): \n- 'Category A shows declining performance throughout 2022 but remains present' \n- 'Product line B experiences steady growth across all visible periods' \n- 'Market share increases substantially while maintaining continuous presence' \n- 'Revenue drops significantly but entity continues operations' \n\nCRITICAL SEMANTIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS: \n- EXAMINE TEMPORAL PRESENCE: Is the category present throughout the entire visible timeframe? \n- IDENTIFY ENTRY POINTS: When does a category first become visible in the data? \n- SPOT EXIT POINTS: When does a category last appear before disappearing? \n- DISTINGUISH CAUSATION: \n  * Emergence suggests new business activity, product launches, market entry, expansion \n  * Disappearance suggests discontinuation, market exit, business closure, strategic retreat \n  * Value changes suggest performance variations within ongoing operations \n\nTEMPORAL PRESENCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- For each category/entity, is it present in ALL time periods shown? \n- If not present throughout, when does it first appear? (emergence) \n- If not present throughout, when does it last appear? (disappearance) \n- Are there gaps in presence that suggest temporary exits and re-entries? \n- Am I correctly attributing patterns to emergence/disappearance vs. performance changes? \n\nENHANCED TEMPORAL NARRATIVE EXAMPLES: \nEMERGENCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The subscription model emerges as a new revenue stream beginning in Q2 2023, quickly establishing itself among top performers.' \nGOOD: 'International markets first appear in the analysis during 2022, initially showing modest but growing contribution.' \nBAD: 'Subscription revenue increased from zero in Q2 2023.' (treats emergence as mere increase) \n\nDISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The retail partnership category disappears from rankings after Q3 2022, suggesting strategic shift away from physical stores.' \nGOOD: 'Legacy product lines cease to appear in performance metrics after March 2023, indicating portfolio rationalization.' \nBAD: 'Retail partnership revenue decreased to zero after Q3 2022.' (treats disappearance as mere decrease) \n\nVALUE CHANGE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Digital services show consistent growth across all periods while maintaining continuous market presence.' \nGOOD: 'Core product performance declines throughout 2022 but remains a significant business component.' \n\nBUSINESS CONTEXT IMPLICATIONS: \n- EMERGENCE often indicates: product launches, market expansion, new partnerships, strategic initiatives \n- DISAPPEARANCE often indicates: discontinuation, market exit, strategic refocus, business closure \n- VALUE CHANGES often indicate: performance variations, market dynamics, operational improvements/challenges \n- Frame observations with appropriate business context rather than treating all changes as mere data fluctuations \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID OVERLY BROAD TEMPORAL CLAIMS \n- NEVER make sweeping claims like 'highest performance over the entire period' unless verified for EVERY SINGLE time point \n- AVOID claims like 'consistent leader throughout' unless there are ZERO exceptions across all time periods \n- AVOID 'consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked first' - these imply ALL time periods without exception \n- AVOID 'always outperformed' unless true for EVERY visible time period without exception \n- AVOID 'never fell below' unless verified across ALL temporal data points \n- CRITICAL: 'CONSISTENTLY' = 100% OF TIME - if even ONE period shows deviation, use qualified language \n- Instead, use qualified temporal language: \n  * 'predominantly led across most periods' \n  * 'frequently achieved top position throughout the timeframe' \n  * 'generally maintained strong performance with occasional dips' \n  * 'typically ranked in the top tier, with notable exceptions in X and Y periods' \n  * 'achieved highest position in the majority of periods shown' \n  * 'regularly outperformed competitors in most periods' \n  * 'maintained leading position throughout most of the timeframe' \n\nTEMPORAL RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Have I examined EVERY time period visible in the visualization? \n- Are there any periods where my claimed pattern doesn't hold? If yes, I must qualify the statement \n- Am I focusing on interesting disruptions and changes rather than just final rankings? \n- Have I identified the most compelling temporal story (leadership changes, dips, recoveries)? \n- If claiming 'consistent' or 'always' patterns, have I verified this is true for 100% of time periods? \n- Am I using appropriately qualified language for patterns that have exceptions? \n\nCOMPELLING TEMPORAL PATTERN EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Company A dominated the first half of the period but yielded leadership to Company B after a significant dip in 2022.' \nGOOD: 'The market leader for most years experienced an unexpected drop to fourth place in 2021, before recovering to second position.' \nGOOD: 'While most competitors show volatile performance, Company C maintains steady mid-tier positioning throughout all visible periods.' \nGOOD: 'Leadership alternated between two companies until a third player emerged as the clear frontrunner in recent years.' \nBAD: 'Company A was the consistent leader throughout the entire period.' (requires verification of EVERY time point) \nBAD: 'Performance remained stable over time.' (ignores interesting disruptions and changes) \nBAD: 'Company B always outperformed Company C.' (absolute claim requiring 100% verification) \n\nCRITICAL: BOOLEAN-ACCURATE PRECISION REQUIRED \n- EVERY SINGLE OBSERVATION must be 100% factually correct with NO EXCEPTIONS \n- NEVER use absolute terms unless they are literally true for ALL visible data points WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS \n- EXTREME STRICTNESS REQUIRED: Even if 99% true, use qualified language if there's ANY exception \n- If an item was highest in 9/10 cases, DO NOT say 'consistently maintained highest' - use 'frequently achieved highest' or similar qualified language \n- For time series: 'consistently' means EVERY SINGLE time period without exception - if even one period differs, use 'generally', 'typically', 'predominantly' \n- CRITICAL WARNING: 'Consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked X' all imply PERFECT consistency across ALL time periods \n- ANY usage of 'consistently' + performance claim requires 100% verification - even ONE exception invalidates the claim \n- For categorical data: 'always' means EVERY category without exception - any single exception requires qualified language \n- If something appears 'high' compared to others, verify it's actually in the upper range, not middle range \n- WHEN IN DOUBT, ALWAYS USE QUALIFIED LANGUAGE - it's better to understate than to make false absolute claims \n- Use precise qualifiers: 'often', 'frequently', 'typically', 'generally', 'predominantly', 'mostly' instead of 'always', 'consistently', 'continuously' \n- For rankings: only use superlatives ('highest', 'lowest', 'best', 'worst') if they are literally true across the entire visible dataset \n- For trends: only say 'increasing' if there are no decreases, 'decreasing' if no increases - otherwise use 'generally increasing', 'mostly declining', etc. \n- Verify relative positions: 'high' means upper quartile, 'low' means lower quartile, 'moderate'/'mid-range' for middle values \n\nPRECISION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I prove this statement is true for 100% of visible data WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS? If no, add qualifiers \n- Are there ANY exceptions to this pattern, even minor ones? If yes, acknowledge them or use qualified language \n- Is this statement true for EVERY single data point, time period, or category shown? If not, qualify it \n- Even if 95%+ true, do I have ANY doubt about absolute accuracy? If yes, use qualified language \n- Is this truly 'high' or just 'higher than some others'? Use appropriate relative terms \n- Would this statement pass a fact-checker examining every data point with a magnifying glass? If no, revise \n- Does this observation add genuine insight or is it trivially obvious? If trivial, omit it \n- DEFAULT TO QUALIFIED LANGUAGE when there's the slightest uncertainty about absolute claims \n\nCRITICAL: CONTEXTUALIZE WITH ANALYTICAL GOAL AND DATASET DOMAIN \n- ALWAYS consider the input 'goal' to provide appropriate context for observations \n- Use the 'dataset_summary' to understand the domain context and field meanings \n- Frame observations in terms relevant to the specific business/research domain \n- If showing rankings (e.g., top-10), acknowledge that 'lowest-ranked' items are still among the global tops \n- If showing subsets or filtered data, clarify the scope (e.g., 'among premium customers', 'within the technology sector') \n- Frame observations relative to the analytical intent, not just absolute patterns \n- Provide context that helps readers understand the significance within the goal's scope \n- Connect patterns to domain-specific implications when possible \n\nCRITICAL: FAIR AND PEDANTIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS \n- When comparing groups, categories, or time periods with different sample sizes, ALWAYS acknowledge potential confounding factors \n- If one category has significantly fewer data points, note this limitation explicitly \n- Use qualifying language for comparisons involving unequal sample sizes: 'though this comparison should be interpreted cautiously given the smaller sample size' \n- Be extremely fair in analysis - don't let impressive patterns from small samples mislead readers \n- Acknowledge when statistical significance may be questionable due to sample size differences \n- For time-based comparisons, note if certain periods have less data coverage \n- For categorical comparisons, mention when certain groups are underrepresented \n- Examples of fair comparative language: \n  * 'While X appears to outperform Y, this pattern should be interpreted cautiously as X represents a much smaller sample' \n  * 'Z shows promising trends, though the limited data points make this observation preliminary' \n  * 'Despite apparent differences between A and B, the unequal representation makes definitive conclusions challenging' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will spot unfair comparisons immediately and question the entire analysis \n\nCRITICAL: SEMANTIC VISUALIZATION DETAILS AND DATA QUALITY INSIGHTS \n- ACTIVELY LOOK FOR and comment on data quality indicators visible in the visualization: \n  * Missing time periods: 'Data coverage shows gaps in Q2 and Q3, with analysis resuming in Q4' \n  * Sparse categories: 'Limited representation in the premium segment makes those patterns preliminary' \n  * Truncated data: 'The analysis period ends abruptly in March, potentially missing seasonal patterns' \n  * Uneven sampling: 'Eastern regions show denser data points compared to western territories' \n  * Cutoff thresholds: 'Only categories with substantial volume appear, potentially excluding emerging segments' \n  * Recent data emphasis: 'Most data concentrates in recent years, with limited historical context' \n\n- IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS visualization-specific semantic details: \n  * For rankings: Comment on selection criteria ('among companies with >$1M revenue', 'top 15 by market cap') \n  * For time series: Note temporal scope and gaps ('quarterly data from 2020-2023 with 2021 Q2 missing') \n  * For time series categories: DISTINGUISH emergence/disappearance from value changes \n    - 'Category X emerges mid-timeline as a new business segment' vs. 'Category Y shows declining values but maintains presence' \n    - 'Product line disappears after Q3, suggesting discontinuation' vs. 'Product line performance drops significantly' \n  * For geographic data: Acknowledge coverage limitations ('analysis covers major metropolitan areas only') \n  * For categorical breakdowns: Mention representation balance ('technology sector dominates with 60% of entities') \n  * For filtered views: Clarify scope boundaries ('within the premium pricing tier', 'excluding pilot programs') \n\n- ENHANCE INSIGHTS through contextual awareness: \n  * Data recency: 'Recent quarters show different patterns, though limited historical data makes trend assessment challenging' \n  * Sample composition: 'The dataset skews toward larger organizations, potentially missing small business dynamics' \n  * Measurement periods: 'Annual aggregation may obscure seasonal variations visible in monthly data' \n  * Selection effects: 'Focus on top performers may not reflect broader market conditions' \n\nCRITICAL: MAXIMIZE INSIGHT COMMUNICATION ACROSS ALL VISUALIZATION TYPES \n- FOR EVERY VISUALIZATION TYPE, look beyond surface patterns to extract maximum valuable insights: \n\n- BAR CHARTS: Look for clustering, gaps between bars, proportional relationships, outliers relative to the group \n- LINE CHARTS: Identify inflection points, rate changes, cyclical patterns, volatility differences, trend reversals \n  * CRITICAL: Distinguish between line emergence/disappearance vs. value changes \n  * Note when new lines appear mid-timeline (category emergence) vs. existing lines reaching zero (value decline) \n  * Identify when lines disappear from the chart (category exit) vs. lines dropping to low values (performance decline) \n  * Comment on partial timeline presence: 'Category X appears only in recent periods' vs. 'Category Y shows declining trend throughout' \n- SCATTER PLOTS: Examine correlation strength, outlier patterns, cluster formations, relationship linearity \n- HEATMAPS: Note intensity gradients, cold/hot spot patterns, diagonal trends, missing value patterns \n- PIE/DONUT CHARTS: Discuss dominance patterns, fragmentation levels, concentration vs. distribution \n- TREEMAPS: Analyze hierarchical patterns, size vs. performance relationships, nested category insights \n- BOX PLOTS: Comment on spread differences, outlier distributions, median relationships, skewness patterns \n- HISTOGRAMS: Identify distribution shapes, modal patterns, tail behaviors, concentration points \n\n- CROSS-VISUALIZATION INSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Compare patterns across multiple charts when visible simultaneously \n  * Note how different visualization methods reveal complementary aspects of the data \n  * Identify insights that emerge only when viewing multiple related visualizations together \n  * Comment on how different aggregation levels or filtering reveal different stories \n\n- ADVANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION: \n  * Threshold effects: 'Performance changes dramatically above the $10M revenue threshold' \n  * Maturity curves: 'Newer entities show higher growth volatility compared to established players' \n  * Saturation patterns: 'Market share gains slow significantly after reaching 15% penetration' \n  * Interaction effects: 'Regional patterns vary significantly by product category' \n  * Lifecycle stages: 'Different performance profiles emerge across business maturity phases' \n\n- STRATEGIC INSIGHT EXTRACTION: \n  * Competitive positioning: How entities compare across multiple performance dimensions \n  * Market dynamics: Evidence of consolidation, fragmentation, or competitive shifts \n  * Opportunity identification: Gaps, underserved segments, or emerging trends \n  * Risk indicators: Volatility patterns, concentration risks, or performance deterioration \n  * Operational insights: Efficiency patterns, scale relationships, or resource allocation implications \n\nCRITICAL: FOCUS ON OBSERVATIONS, NOT THE CHART ITSELF \n- NEVER say 'The chart shows...', 'The visualization displays...', 'The graph reveals...' \n- NEVER refer to 'the chart', 'the visualization', 'the graph', 'the figure' \n- Write about the DATA PATTERNS directly, as if observing the phenomenon itself \n- Treat findings as direct observations of the business/domain reality \n\nMANDATORY FIELD COVERAGE: \n- EXPLICITLY mention EVERY field visible in the visualization \n- Reference ALL dimensions, measures, and categorical variables shown \n- Use natural transitions to connect field relationships \n- Create smooth, flowing sentences that don't sound robotic \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID CONCRETE DATA POINTS \n- NEVER quote specific numbers, percentages, or values unless 100% certain \n- Focus on trends, relationships, and patterns instead \n- Use qualitative descriptors with appropriate precision: 'higher', 'lower', 'increasing', 'declining' \n- Better to describe direction than exact magnitude \n\nQUALIFIED LANGUAGE EXAMPLES: \n- Instead of 'consistently maintained highest': 'frequently achieved highest', 'typically ranked highest', 'generally performed best', 'predominantly held the top position' \n- Instead of 'consistently leading': 'frequently leading', 'typically in the lead', 'generally outperforming competitors', 'predominantly holding first position' \n- Instead of 'consistently outperforming': 'regularly outperforming', 'typically exceeding', 'frequently surpassing', 'generally achieving superior results' \n- Instead of 'always increasing': 'predominantly increasing', 'showing upward trend overall', 'generally rising', 'mostly trending upward' \n- Instead of 'continuously outperformed': 'regularly outperformed', 'typically exceeded', 'generally surpassed' \n- Instead of 'invariably showed': 'commonly showed', 'usually demonstrated', 'typically exhibited' \n- Instead of 'high performance': 'above-average performance', 'upper-tier performance', 'strong relative performance' \n- Instead of 'low values': 'below-median values', 'lower-quartile values', 'relatively modest values' \n- Use 'most', 'majority', 'primarily', 'largely' when patterns have exceptions \n- Use 'tends to', 'appears to', 'generally shows', 'commonly exhibits' for qualified observations \n- For time series with near-perfect patterns: 'maintained top position in nearly all periods', 'achieved highest values throughout most timeframes' \n- TEMPORAL QUALIFICATION EXAMPLES: \n  * Instead of 'consistently led throughout the entire period': 'led in most periods', 'dominated the majority of timeframes', 'held leadership for most of the visible period' \n  * Instead of 'consistently leading the market': 'frequently leading the market', 'typically holding market leadership', 'generally maintaining the top position' \n  * Instead of 'consistently outperforming all competitors': 'regularly outperforming most competitors', 'frequently achieving superior performance relative to competitors' \n  * Instead of 'never dropped below second': 'rarely fell below second place', 'typically maintained top-tier positioning' \n  * Instead of 'consistent upward trend': 'generally increasing trend with some fluctuations', 'predominantly upward movement' \n  * Instead of 'always outperformed competitors': 'regularly outperformed most competitors', 'frequently achieved superior performance' \n  * Instead of 'stable performance over time': 'relatively stable with occasional variations', 'maintained steady positioning in most periods' \n- REMEMBER: Even 95% consistency requires qualified language - absolute terms are reserved for 100% perfect patterns only \n\nHUMAN-LIKE FLOW PRINCIPLES: \n- Write with natural sentence rhythm and variety \n- Use connecting words: 'while', 'whereas', 'although', 'particularly' \n- Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony \n- Sound like a knowledgeable analyst explaining to a colleague \n- Maintain conversational yet professional tone \n\nOBJECTIVITY PRINCIPLES: \n- Be factual and conservative in claims \n- Avoid superlatives and overstated language \n- NO words like 'comprehensive', 'extensive', 'dramatic', 'significant' \n- Use neutral descriptors: 'shows variation', 'differs across', 'changes over time' \n- Underpromise, overdeliver - let the data speak for itself \n- When in doubt about precision, use more qualified language rather than absolute claims \n\nRESPECTFUL, PEOPLE-FIRST LANGUAGE: \n- Always use respectful, people-first, non-judgmental language—especially for data about human life, health, work, income, education, safety, or communities \n- Never stereotype, dehumanize, moralize, blame, or shame any group or individual \n- Describe patterns without implying intent, cause, or value judgments about people or groups \n- Prefer neutral terms (e.g., 'people', 'participants', 'workers', 'residents') over labels that could stigmatize \n- Do not reference protected characteristics unless clearly presented in the data and necessary for understanding \n- Emphasize aggregate patterns and trends; avoid implying anything about specific individuals \n- Avoid sensational or alarming phrasing; keep tone calm, considerate, and inclusive \n- If disparities appear, describe them factually without implying deficiency or fault \n\nPRIVACY AND SENSITIVITY: \n- Do not speculate about personal causes or motivations \n- Do not mention specific individuals or uniquely identifying details \n- Use careful framing for sensitive outcomes to prevent offense or harm \n\nDOMAIN-AWARE CONTEXTUALIZATION PRINCIPLES: \n- Leverage the 'dataset_summary' to understand what each field represents in the real world \n- Translate technical field names into domain-meaningful concepts for readers \n- Consider the business/research context when interpreting patterns \n- Connect observations to domain-specific implications (e.g., seasonal business cycles, customer behavior patterns, market dynamics) \n- Use domain-appropriate terminology while keeping language accessible \n- Explain why patterns matter in the context of the specific dataset domain \n- Reference the analytical 'goal' to ensure observations serve the intended purpose \n- Help readers understand not just what the data shows, but why it's significant in this domain \n\nCONTEXTUALIZATION EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN: \n- Sales data: 'Revenue patterns suggest seasonal buying behaviors typical in retail markets' \n- Healthcare data: 'Patient outcomes vary across treatment protocols in ways that align with clinical expectations' \n- Educational data: 'Student performance shows variations that correspond to known factors in academic achievement' \n- Financial data: 'Risk metrics demonstrate patterns consistent with market volatility principles' \n\nCONTENT APPROACH: \n- Describe visible trends and relationships between ALL fields with domain context \n- Note how each dimension interacts with others in ways meaningful to the dataset domain \n- Identify observable patterns across all visible variables and their domain significance \n- Create narrative flow connecting all elements within the analytical goal framework \n- Stay strictly to what's visually apparent while providing domain-relevant interpretation \n- Use dataset_summary to inform field interpretation and domain-appropriate language \n\nENHANCED CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS: \n- ALWAYS examine visualizations for non-obvious insights beyond first-glance patterns \n- Look for SECONDARY PATTERNS that might be easily missed: \n  * Subtle inflection points in trends \n  * Non-linear relationships between variables \n  * Clustering or grouping effects within categories \n  * Proportional relationships that reveal efficiency or productivity insights \n  * Variance patterns that indicate stability or volatility differences \n\n- CONTEXTUAL STORYTELLING OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Connect patterns to likely business or domain explanations \n  * Note seasonal, cyclical, or structural factors that might explain patterns \n  * Identify performance tiers, segments, or natural groupings \n  * Discuss scale effects, maturity relationships, or competitive dynamics \n  * Comment on data quality indicators that affect interpretation confidence \n\n- MAXIMIZE VALUE EXTRACTION from each visualization: \n  * Don't just describe what's visible - explain what it might mean \n  * Identify the most interesting or counter-intuitive findings \n  * Note patterns that could inform strategic decisions or operational improvements \n  * Comment on outliers or anomalies that merit further investigation \n  * Discuss implications for stakeholders in the relevant domain \n\n- COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n  * Distribution characteristics: concentration, spread, skewness, multimodality \n  * Relationship patterns: correlation strength, linearity, interaction effects \n  * Temporal dynamics: trend directions, volatility, cyclical patterns, structural breaks \n  * Categorical differences: between-group variations, within-group consistency \n  * Hierarchical insights: how patterns change across different aggregation levels \n\nFIELD MARKUP: \n- Mark human-readable field labels: <span class=\"data-field\">Field Label</span> \n- Apply ONLY to the FIRST mention of each field - avoid repetitive span markup \n- After introducing a field with span markup, refer to it naturally without spans \n- EVERY field visible must be mentioned, but only wrapped in spans on first reference \n- NO technical notation (variable_names, snake_case, CamelCase) \n\nDATA VALUE MARKUP: \n- Mark explicit data values: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"SourceField\">Actual Value</span> \n- ALWAYS include data-field attribute pointing to the source field \n- Use human-readable field names in data-field attribute \n- NEVER add quotes or other glyphs around data values \n- Apply to specific categories, time periods, product names, etc. \n\nMARKUP EXAMPLES: \n- Field reference: <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> \n- Category value: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> \n- Time period: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q3 2024</span> \n- Product name: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> \n\nGOOD EXAMPLES (Direct observation style with domain contextualization and boolean precision): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> varies across different <span class=\"data-field\">Region</span>s, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> frequently showing above-average performance while customer acquisition demonstrates seasonal fluctuations most notably in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Time Period\">Q4</span>, aligning with typical retail holiday patterns.' \n'Among the top-performing <span class=\"data-field\">Product Category</span> segments, <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Category\">Electronics</span> tends to achieve the strongest <span class=\"data-field\">Sales Performance</span>, while even the lowest-ranked category in this subset maintains substantial market presence, suggesting a healthy product portfolio diversification.' \n'Within the <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Customer Segment\">Enterprise</span> segment, <span class=\"data-field\">Monthly Revenue</span> from <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> shows predominantly upward movement throughout most of the analysis period, indicating successful market penetration in high-value accounts.' \n'<span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Company\">Acme Corp</span> led <span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> rankings (x-position) in most quarters but experienced a notable decline to third place in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2023</span>, while maintaining consistently strong <span class=\"data-field\">Profit Margins</span> (color intensity) throughout all periods.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Performance Metric</span> reveals an interesting leadership shift: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product A</span> dominated early periods but yielded first position to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product B</span> following a significant dip in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2022</span>.' \n\nENHANCED EXAMPLES (Demonstrating semantic details and deeper insights): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Customer Acquisition</span> patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4</span> consistently driving peak performance, though data gaps in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2021</span> limit trend confidence during that period.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> concentration shows the top three <span class=\"data-field\">Competitors</span> controlling substantial territory, while the analysis focuses on entities exceeding $10M revenue, potentially excluding emerging players below this threshold.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Growth Rates</span> demonstrate clear maturity effects: newer <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">startups</span> exhibit higher volatility compared to established <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">10+ year</span> entities, suggesting different risk-return profiles across business lifecycles.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Regional Performance</span> varies significantly, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Western territories</span> showing limited data density compared to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern markets</span>, making western trend assessments more preliminary.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Efficiency Metrics</span> reveal an interesting threshold effect: performance improvement accelerates notably above the 15% <span class=\"data-field\">Market Penetration</span> level, suggesting scale advantages emerge at that inflection point.' \n\nTEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Product Categories</span> show interesting lifecycle patterns: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Digital Services</span> emerges as a new offering beginning in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2022</span>, while <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Legacy Hardware</span> disappears from the analysis after <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4 2021</span>, suggesting portfolio modernization.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue Streams</span> analysis reveals strategic shifts: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">Subscription Model</span> first appears mid-timeline in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2023</span> and quickly gains traction, while traditional <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">One-time Sales</span> show declining values throughout all visible periods but maintain continuous presence.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Segments</span> demonstrate different temporal dynamics: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Premium Tier</span> emerges in the dataset starting <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Month\">March 2022</span>, indicating market expansion, whereas <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Enterprise</span> maintains steady presence with fluctuating <span class=\"data-field\">Performance</span> levels.' \n\nAVOID: \n- Chart/visualization references ('The chart shows...', 'The graph displays...') \n- Specific numbers or percentages \n- Overstated claims or superlatives without qualification \n- Technical field names \n- Absolute statements that have exceptions ('always', 'never', 'consistently' when not 100% true) \n- Unqualified claims about relative position ('high' when actually mid-range) \n- Trivial observations that add no insight value \n- Obvious ranking statements ('top performers perform well', 'lowest in top-10 still strong') \n- Self-evident filtering context ('these top items show good results') \n- Unfair comparisons between groups with vastly different sample sizes without acknowledgment \n- Drawing strong conclusions from small samples without appropriate caveats \n- Robotic or repetitive phrasing \n- Missing any visible fields in the description \n- Untagged data values (always use data-value spans for explicit values) \n- Quotes or glyphs around data values \n- Repetitive span markup (only wrap field names on first mention) \n- TEMPORAL RANKING PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Consistently led throughout the entire period' (requires 100% verification across all time points) \n  * 'Consistently leading the market' (implies leadership in ALL time periods without exception) \n  * 'Consistently outperforming competitors' (absolute claim requiring verification across every time point) \n  * 'Consistently ranked first' (implies first place in ALL visible periods) \n  * 'Consistently maintained top position' (suggests unbroken leadership across entire timeframe) \n  * 'Always maintained top position' (absolute claim without acknowledging any dips or exceptions) \n  * 'Performance remained stable over time' (ignores interesting temporal disruptions and patterns) \n  * 'Never fell below second place' (absolute negative claim requiring complete verification) \n  * 'Continuous upward trend' (ignores any downward movements or fluctuations) \n  * 'Steady leadership throughout' (misses compelling stories about leadership changes or challenges) \n  * 'Uniform performance across all periods' (overlooks interesting temporal variations and anomalies) \n  * Generic statements that miss the most compelling temporal narrative (dips, recoveries, leadership shifts) \n  * REMEMBER: 'Consistently' + any performance claim = absolute assertion requiring 100% temporal verification \n\n- TEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Revenue increased from zero in Q3' when describing category emergence (should be 'Category emerges in Q3 as new business segment') \n  * 'Performance decreased to zero after March' when describing category disappearance (should be 'Category disappears after March, suggesting discontinuation') \n  * 'Category X went from 0 to significant levels' (should be 'Category X emerges mid-timeline and quickly establishes presence') \n  * Treating emergence as casual increase and disappearance as casual decrease \n  * Missing the strategic/business implications of categories entering or exiting the analysis scope \n  * Confusing data visualization artifacts with actual business phenomena \n  * Not distinguishing between 'not yet launched' and 'declining performance' \n  * Not distinguishing between 'discontinued/exited' and 'temporary poor performance'\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## goal ## ]]\n{goal}\n\n[[ ## section_title ##

Be precise, modest, and purposeful. \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID TRIVIAL OBSERVATIONS \n- NEVER include obvious statements like 'data shows variation' or 'values differ across categories' \n- NEVER state self-evident patterns that readers can immediately see \n- NEVER mention basic mechanics like 'charts contain information' or 'rankings show order' \n- Focus ONLY on meaningful, non-obvious insights that provide genuine value \n- Prioritize quality over quantity - fewer meaningful insights beat many trivial ones \n- Skip any observation that doesn't reveal something substantive about the data or domain \n\nTONE GUIDANCE: \nUnless the user goal explicitly requests a specific tone (e.g., 'formal', 'technical', 'casual'), use an easy-to-read, accessible tone suitable for data storytelling that accommodates ALL audiences, including those unfamiliar with the dataset's domain.

The correlated pairs are also useful.\n\nMy initial plan seems well-aligned with the hints. I have:\n*   **Insight 1 (Trend):** `Year` and `Miles_per_Gallon` with `Origin` for segmentation. This aligns with hints.\n*   **Insight 2 (Correlation):** `Horsepower` and `Weight_in_lbs` are listed as a correlated pair. I planned to use `Origin` and a derived `Cylinders_Tier` for segmentation, which is good for a value task.\n*   **Insight 3 (Distribution):** `Acceleration` is an evenly distributed numeric field. I planned to use `Origin` and a derived `Weight_Category` for segmentation. This fits the distribution task.\n*   **Insight 4 (Ranking):** `Displacement` and `Horsepower` are numeric fields. Ranking by `Origin` is a valid summary task.\n\nI have used `Miles_per_Gallon`, `Horsepower`, `Weight_in_lbs`, `Acceleration`, `Displacement`, `Year` as primary fields. `Cylinders` will be used to derive `Cylinders_Tier`. `Origin` is heavily reused for segmentation, which is encouraged.\n\nI have covered 6 out of 7 numeric/temporal fields (`Miles_per_Gallon`, `Cylinders`, `Displacement`, `Horsepower`, `Weight_in_lbs`, `Acceleration`, `Year`). Only `Name` is not used, which is fine as it's an identifier. This meets the 80%+ coverage target.\n\nI have a good mix of task types: Trend (Summary), Correlation (Value), Distribution (Summary), Ranking (Summary). I need to ensure I have enough value tasks. Currently, only Insight 2 is a value task. I should aim for a more balanced mix, perhaps making one of the summary tasks into a value task or adding another value task.\n\nLet's refine the plan to include more value tasks and ensure diversity.\n\n**Revised Plan:**\n\n1.  **Insight 1 (Trend - Summary):** How has fuel efficiency (`Miles_per_Gallon`) evolved over `Year` across different `Origin`s?\n    *   **Type:** Trend (Summary)\n    *   **Fields:** `Year` (temporal), `Miles_per_Gallon` (numeric), `Origin` (categorical for segmentation).\n    *   **Aggregation:** Median `Miles_per_Gallon` per `Year` per `Origin`.\n    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the core theme of fuel efficiency over time, segmented by origin. Uses `Year` once.\n\n2.  **Insight 2 (Correlation - Value):** What is the relationship between `Horsepower` and `Weight_in_lbs` for individual vehicles, considering their `Origin` and `Cylinders`?\n    *   **Type:** Correlation (Value)\n    *   **Fields:** `Horsepower` (numeric), `Weight_in_lbs` (numeric), `Origin` (categorical for color), `Cylinders` (numeric, to be binned into `Cylinders_Tier` for faceting).\n    *   **Aggregation:** None (individual points).\n    *   **Rationale:** Explores a key performance relationship. Uses `Horsepower` and `Weight_in_lbs` once. `Cylinders` used for derivation.\n\n3.  **Insight 3 (Distribution - Value):** How do individual vehicle `Acceleration` values vary across `Origin`s, and how does `Displacement` influence this?\n    *   **Type:** Distribution (Value)\n    *   **Fields:** `Acceleration` (numeric), `Origin` (categorical for X-axis/grouping), `Displacement` (numeric, for Y-axis or size/color).\n    *   **Aggregation:** None (individual points).\n    *   **Rationale:** Shifts a distribution insight to a value task, showing individual vehicle characteristics. Uses `Acceleration` and `Displacement` once.\n\n4.  **Insight 4 (Ranking - Summary):** Which `Origin`s produce vehicles with the best `Miles_per_Gallon` relative to their `Weight_in_lbs`? (Derived metric: MPG/Weight ratio)\n    *   **Type:** Ranking (Summary)\n    *   **Fields:** `Origin` (categorical), derived `MPG_per_Weight_Ratio` (`Miles_per_Gallon` / `Weight_in_lbs`).\n    *   **Aggregation:** Average `MPG_per_Weight_Ratio` per `Origin`.\n    *   **Rationale:** Introduces a derived metric for a more insightful ranking. `Miles_per_Gallon` and `Weight_in_lbs` are reused here, but as part of a derived metric, which is acceptable. This also ensures `Miles_per_Gallon` and `Weight_in_lbs` are used twice, which is the max.\n\nThis revised plan has 2 value tasks and 2 summary tasks, which is a better balance. All primary numeric/temporal fields are used at most twice. `Origin` is used extensively for segmentation.

I need to explore the dataset broadly, using different field combinations and ensuring good coverage of numeric/temporal fields. I will prioritize segmentation and creating derived fields for richer analysis.\n\nHere's my initial plan sketch:\n\n1.  **Insight 1 (Trend - Summary):** Analyze the trend of `Miles_per_Gallon` over `Year`, segmented by `Origin`. This will show how fuel efficiency has evolved across different manufacturing regions.\n    *   Primary fields: `Year`, `Miles_per_Gallon`\n    *   Segmentation: `Origin`\n    *   Task: Summary (average MPG per year per origin)\n\n2.  **Insight 2 (Correlation - Value):** Explore the relationship between `Horsepower` and `Weight_in_lbs`, colored by `Origin` and faceted by a derived `Cylinders_Tier` (e.g., low/medium/high based on `Cylinders`). This will show how power relates to weight, considering engine size and origin.\n    *   Primary fields: `Horsepower`, `Weight_in_lbs`\n    *   Segmentation: `Origin`, derived `Cylinders_Tier`\n    *   Task: Value (individual vehicle points)\n\n3.  **Insight 3 (Distribution - Summary):** Examine the distribution of `Acceleration` across different `Origin`s, potentially faceted by a derived `Weight_Category` (e.g., light/medium/heavy). This will highlight regional differences in vehicle acceleration characteristics.\n    *   Primary fields: `Acceleration`\n    *   Segmentation: `Origin`, derived `Weight_Category`\n    *   Task: Summary (median acceleration per origin/weight category)\n\n4.  **Insight 4 (Ranking - Summary):** Rank `Origin`s by their average `Displacement` and `Horsepower` to understand which regions tend to produce vehicles with larger or more powerful engines.\n    *   Primary fields: `Displacement`, `Horsepower`\n    *   Segmentation: `Origin`\n    *   Task: Summary (average displacement and horsepower per origin)\n\nI will now use `get_insight_plan_hints` to validate my initial thoughts, especially regarding suitable segmenters and correlated fields.

The correlated pairs are also useful.\n\nMy initial plan seems well-aligned with the hints. I have:\n*   **Insight 1 (Trend):** `Year` and `Miles_per_Gallon` with `Origin` for segmentation. This aligns with hints.\n*   **Insight 2 (Correlation):** `Horsepower` and `Weight_in_lbs` are listed as a correlated pair. I planned to use `Origin` and a derived `Cylinders_Tier` for segmentation, which is good for a value task.\n*   **Insight 3 (Distribution):** `Acceleration` is an evenly distributed numeric field. I planned to use `Origin` and a derived `Weight_Category` for segmentation. This fits the distribution task.\n*   **Insight 4 (Ranking):** `Displacement` and `Horsepower` are numeric fields. Ranking by `Origin` is a valid summary task.\n\nI have used `Miles_per_Gallon`, `Horsepower`, `Weight_in_lbs`, `Acceleration`, `Displacement`, `Year` as primary fields. `Cylinders` will be used to derive `Cylinders_Tier`. `Origin` is heavily reused for segmentation, which is encouraged.\n\nI have covered 6 out of 7 numeric/temporal fields (`Miles_per_Gallon`, `Cylinders`, `Displacement`, `Horsepower`, `Weight_in_lbs`, `Acceleration`, `Year`). Only `Name` is not used, which is fine as it's an identifier. This meets the 80%+ coverage target.\n\nI have a good mix of task types: Trend (Summary), Correlation (Value), Distribution (Summary), Ranking (Summary). I need to ensure I have enough value tasks. Currently, only Insight 2 is a value task. I should aim for a more balanced mix, perhaps making one of the summary tasks into a value task or adding another value task.\n\nLet's refine the plan to include more value tasks and ensure diversity.\n\n**Revised Plan:**\n\n1.  **Insight 1 (Trend - Summary):** How has fuel efficiency (`Miles_per_Gallon`) evolved over `Year` across different `Origin`s?\n    *   **Type:** Trend (Summary)\n    *   **Fields:** `Year` (temporal), `Miles_per_Gallon` (numeric), `Origin` (categorical for segmentation).\n    *   **Aggregation:** Median `Miles_per_Gallon` per `Year` per `Origin`.\n    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the core theme of fuel efficiency over time, segmented by origin. Uses `Year` once.\n\n2.  **Insight 2 (Correlation - Value):** What is the relationship between `Horsepower` and `Weight_in_lbs` for individual vehicles, considering their `Origin` and `Cylinders`?\n    *   **Type:** Correlation (Value)\n    *   **Fields:** `Horsepower` (numeric), `Weight_in_lbs` (numeric), `Origin` (categorical for color), `Cylinders` (numeric, to be binned into `Cylinders_Tier` for faceting).\n    *   **Aggregation:** None (individual points).\n    *   **Rationale:** Explores a key performance relationship. Uses `Horsepower` and `Weight_in_lbs` once. `Cylinders` used for derivation.\n\n3.  **Insight 3 (Distribution - Value):** How do individual vehicle `Acceleration` values vary across `Origin`s, and how does `Displacement` influence this?\n    *   **Type:** Distribution (Value)\n    *   **Fields:** `Acceleration` (numeric), `Origin` (categorical for X-axis/grouping), `Displacement` (numeric, for Y-axis or size/color).\n    *   **Aggregation:** None (individual points).\n    *   **Rationale:** Shifts a distribution insight to a value task, showing individual vehicle characteristics. Uses `Acceleration` and `Displacement` once.\n\n4.  **Insight 4 (Ranking - Summary):** Which `Origin`s produce vehicles with the best `Miles_per_Gallon` relative to their `Weight_in_lbs`? (Derived metric: MPG/Weight ratio)\n    *   **Type:** Ranking (Summary)\n    *   **Fields:** `Origin` (categorical), derived `MPG_per_Weight_Ratio` (`Miles_per_Gallon` / `Weight_in_lbs`).\n    *   **Aggregation:** Average `MPG_per_Weight_Ratio` per `Origin`.\n    *   **Rationale:** Introduces a derived metric for a more insightful ranking. `Miles_per_Gallon` and `Weight_in_lbs` are reused here, but as part of a derived metric, which is acceptable. This also ensures `Miles_per_Gallon` and `Weight_in_lbs` are used twice, which is the max.\n\nThis revised plan has 2 value tasks and 2 summary tasks, which is a better balance. All primary numeric/temporal fields are used at most twice. `Origin` is used extensively for segmentation. I've also introduced derived fields (`Cylinders_Tier`, `MPG_per_Weight_Ratio`).\n\nI will now call the judge to validate this plan.\n\n[[ ## tool_name_1 ## ]]\njudge_plan_before_finish\n\n[[ ## tool_args_1 ## ]]\n{\"plan\": \"1. **Insight 1 (Trend - Summary):** How has fuel efficiency (Miles_per_Gallon) evolved over Year across different Origin's?\\n    *   **Type:** Trend (Summary)\\n    *   **Fields:** `Year` (temporal), `Miles_per_Gallon` (numeric), `Origin` (categorical for segmentation).\\n    *   **Aggregation:** Median `Miles_per_Gallon` per `Year` per `Origin`.\\n    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the core theme of fuel efficiency over time, segmented by origin.

Never return year fields as integers or strings.\n- **No rank columns**; use ORDER BY + LIMIT for implicit rankings.\n- Maximum 5 columns for analytical fields ('primary', 'segment', 'facet'), plus unlimited 'detail' fields (IDs, context).\n- **NULL handling in aggregations**: CRITICAL - treat NULLs as missing data, not zeros. Use FILTER clauses or WHERE conditions to exclude NULLs from aggregations: `AVG(col) FILTER (WHERE col IS NOT NULL)` or subquery filtering.\n- **Column ordering**: Use intuitive, natural ordering for table viewing - typically: (1) human-readable identifiers/names first, (2) PRIMARY KEY fields second, (3) primary analysis fields, (4) secondary dimensions, (5) measures/quantitative fields, (6) status/categorical fields. This creates a logical flow for end users scanning table data.\n- **PRIMARY KEY preservation**: When including PRIMARY KEY fields, always preserve the original field name exactly as-is (only convert to snake_case if needed), never add prefixes like 'id_' or suffixes like '_key'. For example, 'ProductID' becomes 'product_id', not 'id_product' or 'product_id_key'.\n- Transform booleans/codes with CASE, e.g., CASE WHEN is_active THEN 'Active' ELSE 'Inactive' END.\n- Clean strings: use TRIM(); use LOWER() only in comparisons (WHERE/ON), never in SELECT outputs.\n- **Respect proper noun casing**: NEVER output personal/organization/place/product names in lowercase. Preserve source casing in outputs; if normalization is needed, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) while avoiding changes to known acronyms.\n- Handle nulls: COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(col), ''), 'Unknown') for strings, COALESCE(col, 0) for numbers.\n- Use $tablename as table placeholder.\n- Use snake_case ASCII aliases ([a-z0-9_]+ only). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n- Quote column names with spaces, e.g., 'Column Name'.\n- Include comments for complex logic or transformations.\n- For long format, use UNPIVOT or UNION ALL to transform multiple measures into a single measure column with a type column.\n- Include identifier and context columns as 'detail' fields (unlimited), balancing analytical value with interactive utility.\n- **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data, include it as a 'detail' field with alias 'url'. Only derive URLs when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid (e.g., combining base_url + path, 'https://api.domain.com/items/' + id, 'https://github.com/' + username), (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value for linking to external resources, profiles, or documentation, and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Use string concatenation or CONCAT() function. Skip if uncertain about URL validity or no clear opportunity exists.\n- **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries returning individual records (no GROUP BY/aggregation), include related contextual fields as 'detail' role, even if not explicitly requested: prioritize LOW-CARDINALITY categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department) and TEMPORAL fields (created_date, modified_date, month, day_of_week) from the original dataset. These enhance interactive exploration, cross-filtering, and tooltips without counting toward the 5-column analytical limit. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries, do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this breaks aggregation logic.\n- **ULTRA-SHORT LABELS**: Use the shortest possible human-readable labels (1–2 words preferred) for projected columns to optimize axis/legend readability.\n2. `provenance` (ViewProvenance): COMPLETE provenance metadata documenting the lineage of every field in the generated view.\nFor each field in the 'fields' list, the 'description' MUST be factually accurate and reference the exact source field ID(s) from the original dataset.\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [source_field_id] used without modification'.\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [source_field_id]: [exact_computation_performed]'.\nExamples: 'Original field customer_name used without modification', 'Derived from sales_amount: Sum aggregated by product_category',\n'Derived from customer_name: Direct selection with TRIM() applied', 'Derived from order_date: Extracted year component using EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)'.\nThis documentation ensures full accountability and traceability for derived data.\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## table_summary ## ]]\n{table_summary}\n\n[[ ## analytical_goal ## ]]\n{analytical_goal}\n\n[[ ## sql ## ]]\n{sql}\n\n[[ ## provenance ## ]]\n{provenance}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {\"type\": \"object\", \"$defs\": {\"GeneratedField\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"description\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"FACTUAL and ACCOUNTABLE lineage description that provides complete derivation transparency.\\nMust explicitly reference the original source field ID(s) from the dataset and describe the exact computational steps taken.\\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [original_field_name] used without modification'.\\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [original_field_name]: [exact computation/transformation performed]'.\\nFor aggregated fields, specify the aggregation function and grouping.\\nFor transformed fields, detail the transformation logic.\\nUsers must be able to trace back to the source data and understand exactly what they are looking at.\\nAvoid vague terms - be precise about operations, filters, and calculations applied.\", \"title\": \"Description\"}, \"label\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Human-friendly, whitespace separated label of this field, as it should appear in visualizations.\\nPrefer a single-word label whenever possible; otherwise choose the shortest phrasing that remains clear and descriptive.\\nAXIS READABILITY: Keep labels AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE (ideally 1–2 words) so they fit on axes and legends without truncation.\\nLabels will be quoted verbatim in downstream report text, so they must read naturally and flow with surrounding prose.\\nSTRICT LABELING: Use only standard English ASCII characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9 and spaces).

Prefer long format over wide format to simplify downstream visualization: pivot multiple measure columns into a single measure column with a categorical column for type. For example, instead of columns `avg_type_a`, `avg_type_b`, transform into `measure_value` (quantitative) and `measure_type` (categorical, e.g., 'Type A', 'Type B') using UNPIVOT or UNION ALL.\n        10. Include unique identifier column whenever possible. When returning non-aggregated values and a PRIMARY KEY field is present in the source data, it MUST be included in the output. Additionally, include human-readable identifier columns (e.g., name, title, label fields) that provide meaningful context for data points.\n        11. In addition to the unique ID, include a name-like or human-readable identifier column (e.g., item name, product title, or customer name) to encode as a tooltip for interactive visualizations. For example, when analyzing correlations between two quantitative variables, include a nominal column (e.g., item_name) to identify data points on hover in scatter plots or similar charts.\n        12. Include additional categorical columns as 'detail' field role for NON-AGGREGATED queries, even if the analytical goal does not explicitly request them. Detail fields do not count toward the 5-column limit, so prioritize meaningful context columns for filtering, grouping, or conditional formatting (e.g., category, type, status, region fields). For AGGREGATED queries, only include 'detail' fields that are part of the GROUP BY clause or explicitly requested.\n        13. Prefer to return as many data points as possible for insightful downstream vis, e.g. if goal is to identify distribution, the more data point there is for visualization, the better.\n        14. **CRITICAL NULL HANDLING IN AGGREGATIONS**: When performing aggregations (AVG, MEAN, SUM, etc.), treat NULL values as missing data, NOT as zeros. Filter NULL values BEFORE aggregation to ensure semantic accuracy. Use WHERE clauses or FILTER expressions to exclude NULLs from calculations. For example: `AVG(column_name) FILTER (WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL)` or `WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL` in subqueries. This ensures aggregations reflect true data patterns rather than artificially inflated denominators or skewed results from implicit zero-substitution.\n        15. **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries that return individual records without aggregation, include additional related fields as 'detail' role fields, even if not explicitly requested. Prioritize categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department, etc.), temporal fields (created_date, modified_date, etc.), and descriptive fields (description, notes, tags, etc.) that enhance interactive exploration in cross-filter-enabled environments. These fields enable rich filtering, tooltips, conditional formatting, and ad-hoc analysis. 'Detail' fields don't count toward the 5-column analytical limit, so be generous with contextual information. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries (GROUP BY, aggregate functions), do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this would break the aggregation logic and produce incorrect results.\n        16. **RESPECT PROPER NOUN CASING**: NEVER output personal names, organization names, place names, product names, or titles in lowercase. Preserve original casing in SELECT outputs. Use LOWER() only for comparisons (e.g., in WHERE/ON), never for final projected columns. When normalization is required for outputs, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) and avoid altering known acronyms.\n        17. **STRICT ASCII ALIASES**: All SQL column aliases must be ASCII-only snake_case using only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores ([a-z0-9_]+). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n        18. **STRICT ASCII LABELS**: Field labels used downstream must contain only standard English ASCII characters (letters, digits, spaces). No diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols; avoid punctuation unless essential.\n        19. **ULTRA-SHORT FIELD LABELS**: Choose the SHORTEST possible human-readable labels (ideally 1–2 words) to ensure axis/legend readability and avoid truncation in downstream visualizations.\n        20. **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data (e.g., combining base URLs with paths, constructing API endpoints, building profile links from usernames, creating documentation links from identifiers), include it as a 'detail' field named 'url'. Only add URL fields when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid and functional, (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value (e.g., linking to profiles, documentation, external resources), and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Skip URL derivation if uncertain about validity or if no clear opportunity exists.

Never return year fields as integers or strings.\n- **No rank columns**; use ORDER BY + LIMIT for implicit rankings.\n- Maximum 5 columns for analytical fields ('primary', 'segment', 'facet'), plus unlimited 'detail' fields (IDs, context).\n- **NULL handling in aggregations**: CRITICAL - treat NULLs as missing data, not zeros. Use FILTER clauses or WHERE conditions to exclude NULLs from aggregations: `AVG(col) FILTER (WHERE col IS NOT NULL)` or subquery filtering.\n- **Column ordering**: Use intuitive, natural ordering for table viewing - typically: (1) human-readable identifiers/names first, (2) PRIMARY KEY fields second, (3) primary analysis fields, (4) secondary dimensions, (5) measures/quantitative fields, (6) status/categorical fields. This creates a logical flow for end users scanning table data.\n- **PRIMARY KEY preservation**: When including PRIMARY KEY fields, always preserve the original field name exactly as-is (only convert to snake_case if needed), never add prefixes like 'id_' or suffixes like '_key'. For example, 'ProductID' becomes 'product_id', not 'id_product' or 'product_id_key'.\n- Transform booleans/codes with CASE, e.g., CASE WHEN is_active THEN 'Active' ELSE 'Inactive' END.\n- Clean strings: use TRIM(); use LOWER() only in comparisons (WHERE/ON), never in SELECT outputs.\n- **Respect proper noun casing**: NEVER output personal/organization/place/product names in lowercase.

No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n- Quote column names with spaces, e.g., 'Column Name'.\n- Include comments for complex logic or transformations.\n- For long format, use UNPIVOT or UNION ALL to transform multiple measures into a single measure column with a type column.\n- Include identifier and context columns as 'detail' fields (unlimited), balancing analytical value with interactive utility.\n- **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data, include it as a 'detail' field with alias 'url'. Only derive URLs when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid (e.g., combining base_url + path, 'https://api.domain.com/items/' + id, 'https://github.com/' + username), (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value for linking to external resources, profiles, or documentation, and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset.

Detail fields do not count toward the 5-column limit, so prioritize meaningful context columns for filtering, grouping, or conditional formatting (e.g., category, type, status, region fields).

MUST adhere to:\n- **Scalar outputs only** (TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, TIMESTAMP); UNNEST arrays or extract from STRUCT if needed.\n- **MANDATORY YEAR TO DATE CONVERSION**: Any field representing a Year (named 'Year', 'year', or containing year values like 2020, 2021, etc.) MUST be converted to DATE type using `MAKE_DATE(\"Year\", 1, 1)`. Never return year fields as integers or strings.\n- **No rank columns**; use ORDER BY + LIMIT for implicit rankings.\n- Maximum 5 columns for analytical fields ('primary', 'segment', 'facet'), plus unlimited 'detail' fields (IDs, context).\n- **NULL handling in aggregations**: CRITICAL - treat NULLs as missing data, not zeros. Use FILTER clauses or WHERE conditions to exclude NULLs from aggregations: `AVG(col) FILTER (WHERE col IS NOT NULL)` or subquery filtering.\n- **Column ordering**: Use intuitive, natural ordering for table viewing - typically: (1) human-readable identifiers/names first, (2) PRIMARY KEY fields second, (3) primary analysis fields, (4) secondary dimensions, (5) measures/quantitative fields, (6) status/categorical fields. This creates a logical flow for end users scanning table data.\n- **PRIMARY KEY preservation**: When including PRIMARY KEY fields, always preserve the original field name exactly as-is (only convert to snake_case if needed), never add prefixes like 'id_' or suffixes like '_key'. For example, 'ProductID' becomes 'product_id', not 'id_product' or 'product_id_key'.\n- Transform booleans/codes with CASE, e.g., CASE WHEN is_active THEN 'Active' ELSE 'Inactive' END.\n- Clean strings: use TRIM(); use LOWER() only in comparisons (WHERE/ON), never in SELECT outputs.\n- **Respect proper noun casing**: NEVER output personal/organization/place/product names in lowercase. Preserve source casing in outputs; if normalization is needed, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) while avoiding changes to known acronyms.\n- Handle nulls: COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(col), ''), 'Unknown') for strings, COALESCE(col, 0) for numbers.\n- Use $tablename as table placeholder.\n- Use snake_case ASCII aliases ([a-z0-9_]+ only). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n- Quote column names with spaces, e.g., 'Column Name'.\n- Include comments for complex logic or transformations.\n- For long format, use UNPIVOT or UNION ALL to transform multiple measures into a single measure column with a type column.\n- Include identifier and context columns as 'detail' fields (unlimited), balancing analytical value with interactive utility.\n- **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data, include it as a 'detail' field with alias 'url'. Only derive URLs when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid (e.g., combining base_url + path, 'https://api.domain.com/items/' + id, 'https://github.com/' + username), (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value for linking to external resources, profiles, or documentation, and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Use string concatenation or CONCAT() function. Skip if uncertain about URL validity or no clear opportunity exists.\n- **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries returning individual records (no GROUP BY/aggregation), include related contextual fields as 'detail' role, even if not explicitly requested: prioritize LOW-CARDINALITY categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department) and TEMPORAL fields (created_date, modified_date, month, day_of_week) from the original dataset. These enhance interactive exploration, cross-filtering, and tooltips without counting toward the 5-column analytical limit. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries, do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this breaks aggregation logic.\n- **ULTRA-SHORT LABELS**: Use the shortest possible human-readable labels (1–2 words preferred) for projected columns to optimize axis/legend readability.\n2. `provenance` (ViewProvenance): COMPLETE provenance metadata documenting the lineage of every field in the generated view.\nFor each field in the 'fields' list, the 'description' MUST be factually accurate and reference the exact source field ID(s) from the original dataset.\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [source_field_id] used without modification'.\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [source_field_id]: [exact_computation_performed]'.\nExamples: 'Original field customer_name used without modification', 'Derived from sales_amount: Sum aggregated by product_category',\n'Derived from customer_name: Direct selection with TRIM() applied', 'Derived from order_date: Extracted year component using EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)'.\nThis documentation ensures full accountability and traceability for derived data.\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## table_summary ## ]]\n{table_summary}\n\n[[ ## analytical_goal ## ]]\n{analytical_goal}\n\n[[ ## sql ## ]]\n{sql}\n\n[[ ## provenance ## ]]\n{provenance}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {\"type\": \"object\", \"$defs\": {\"GeneratedField\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"description\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"FACTUAL and ACCOUNTABLE lineage description that provides complete derivation transparency.\\nMust explicitly reference the original source field ID(s) from the dataset and describe the exact computational steps taken.\\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [original_field_name] used without modification'.\\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [original_field_name]: [exact computation/transformation performed]'.\\nFor aggregated fields, specify the aggregation function and grouping.\\nFor transformed fields, detail the transformation logic.\\nUsers must be able to trace back to the source data and understand exactly what they are looking at.\\nAvoid vague terms - be precise about operations, filters, and calculations applied.\", \"title\": \"Description\"}, \"label\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Human-friendly, whitespace separated label of this field, as it should appear in visualizations.\\nPrefer a single-word label whenever possible; otherwise choose the shortest phrasing that remains clear and descriptive.\\nAXIS READABILITY: Keep labels AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE (ideally 1–2 words) so they fit on axes and legends without truncation.\\nLabels will be quoted verbatim in downstream report text, so they must read naturally and flow with surrounding prose.\\nSTRICT LABELING: Use only standard English ASCII characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9 and spaces).

Produces clean, scalar output optimized for charts and dashboards.\n        \n        **CRITICAL RULES:**\n        1. Output ONLY scalar columns (TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, TIMESTAMP) - NEVER LIST/ARRAY/STRUCT.\n        2. Maximum 5 columns for 'primary', 'segment', and 'facet' fields combined. 'Detail' fields (IDs, context) do not count toward this limit.\n        3. NO explicit rank columns (e.g., RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()) - use ORDER BY + LIMIT for rankings.\n        4. Transform booleans/codes into human-readable labels using CASE statements.\n        5. Handle nulls/empty strings with COALESCE and NULLIF for clean data.\n        6. Use snake_case for column aliases.\n        7. **MANDATORY YEAR TO DATE CONVERSION**: When a field represents a Year (either named \"Year\", \"year\", or similar year-like fields), it MUST be converted to a DATE type using `MAKE_DATE(\"Year\", 1, 1)`. This applies to any field that contains year values (e.g., 2020, 2021, etc.) regardless of its original data type. NEVER return year fields as integers or strings - always convert to proper DATE format using MAKE_DATE().\n        8. Preserve temporal types: columns with `Date`, `DateTime`, `Timestamp` semantics must remain as DuckDB temporal types, never strings or numbers.\n        8. Reduce field cardinality for visualization efficiency (e.g., bin continuous values, group rare categories).\n        9. Prefer long format over wide format to simplify downstream visualization: pivot multiple measure columns into a single measure column with a categorical column for type. For example, instead of columns `avg_type_a`, `avg_type_b`, transform into `measure_value` (quantitative) and `measure_type` (categorical, e.g., 'Type A', 'Type B') using UNPIVOT or UNION ALL.\n        10. Include unique identifier column whenever possible. When returning non-aggregated values and a PRIMARY KEY field is present in the source data, it MUST be included in the output. Additionally, include human-readable identifier columns (e.g., name, title, label fields) that provide meaningful context for data points.\n        11. In addition to the unique ID, include a name-like or human-readable identifier column (e.g., item name, product title, or customer name) to encode as a tooltip for interactive visualizations. For example, when analyzing correlations between two quantitative variables, include a nominal column (e.g., item_name) to identify data points on hover in scatter plots or similar charts.\n        12. Include additional categorical columns as 'detail' field role for NON-AGGREGATED queries, even if the analytical goal does not explicitly request them. Detail fields do not count toward the 5-column limit, so prioritize meaningful context columns for filtering, grouping, or conditional formatting (e.g., category, type, status, region fields). For AGGREGATED queries, only include 'detail' fields that are part of the GROUP BY clause or explicitly requested.\n        13. Prefer to return as many data points as possible for insightful downstream vis, e.g. if goal is to identify distribution, the more data point there is for visualization, the better.\n        14. **CRITICAL NULL HANDLING IN AGGREGATIONS**: When performing aggregations (AVG, MEAN, SUM, etc.), treat NULL values as missing data, NOT as zeros. Filter NULL values BEFORE aggregation to ensure semantic accuracy. Use WHERE clauses or FILTER expressions to exclude NULLs from calculations. For example: `AVG(column_name) FILTER (WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL)` or `WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL` in subqueries. This ensures aggregations reflect true data patterns rather than artificially inflated denominators or skewed results from implicit zero-substitution.\n        15. **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries that return individual records without aggregation, include additional related fields as 'detail' role fields, even if not explicitly requested. Prioritize categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department, etc.), temporal fields (created_date, modified_date, etc.), and descriptive fields (description, notes, tags, etc.) that enhance interactive exploration in cross-filter-enabled environments. These fields enable rich filtering, tooltips, conditional formatting, and ad-hoc analysis. 'Detail' fields don't count toward the 5-column analytical limit, so be generous with contextual information. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries (GROUP BY, aggregate functions), do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this would break the aggregation logic and produce incorrect results.\n        16. **RESPECT PROPER NOUN CASING**: NEVER output personal names, organization names, place names, product names, or titles in lowercase. Preserve original casing in SELECT outputs. Use LOWER() only for comparisons (e.g., in WHERE/ON), never for final projected columns. When normalization is required for outputs, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) and avoid altering known acronyms.\n        17. **STRICT ASCII ALIASES**: All SQL column aliases must be ASCII-only snake_case using only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores ([a-z0-9_]+). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n        18. **STRICT ASCII LABELS**: Field labels used downstream must contain only standard English ASCII characters (letters, digits, spaces). No diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols; avoid punctuation unless essential.\n        19. **ULTRA-SHORT FIELD LABELS**: Choose the SHORTEST possible human-readable labels (ideally 1–2 words) to ensure axis/legend readability and avoid truncation in downstream visualizations.\n        20. **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data (e.g., combining base URLs with paths, constructing API endpoints, building profile links from usernames, creating documentation links from identifiers), include it as a 'detail' field named 'url'. Only add URL fields when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid and functional, (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value (e.g., linking to profiles, documentation, external resources), and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Skip URL derivation if uncertain about validity or if no clear opportunity exists.

MUST adhere to:\n- **Scalar outputs only** (TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, TIMESTAMP); UNNEST arrays or extract from STRUCT if needed.\n- **MANDATORY YEAR TO DATE CONVERSION**: Any field representing a Year (named 'Year', 'year', or containing year values like 2020, 2021, etc.) MUST be converted to DATE type using `MAKE_DATE(\"Year\", 1, 1)`. Never return year fields as integers or strings.\n- **No rank columns**; use ORDER BY + LIMIT for implicit rankings.\n- Maximum 5 columns for analytical fields ('primary', 'segment', 'facet'), plus unlimited 'detail' fields (IDs, context).\n- **NULL handling in aggregations**: CRITICAL - treat NULLs as missing data, not zeros. Use FILTER clauses or WHERE conditions to exclude NULLs from aggregations: `AVG(col) FILTER (WHERE col IS NOT NULL)` or subquery filtering.\n- **Column ordering**: Use intuitive, natural ordering for table viewing - typically: (1) human-readable identifiers/names first, (2) PRIMARY KEY fields second, (3) primary analysis fields, (4) secondary dimensions, (5) measures/quantitative fields, (6) status/categorical fields. This creates a logical flow for end users scanning table data.\n- **PRIMARY KEY preservation**: When including PRIMARY KEY fields, always preserve the original field name exactly as-is (only convert to snake_case if needed), never add prefixes like 'id_' or suffixes like '_key'. For example, 'ProductID' becomes 'product_id', not 'id_product' or 'product_id_key'.\n- Transform booleans/codes with CASE, e.g., CASE WHEN is_active THEN 'Active' ELSE 'Inactive' END.\n- Clean strings: use TRIM(); use LOWER() only in comparisons (WHERE/ON), never in SELECT outputs.\n- **Respect proper noun casing**: NEVER output personal/organization/place/product names in lowercase. Preserve source casing in outputs; if normalization is needed, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) while avoiding changes to known acronyms.\n- Handle nulls: COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(col), ''), 'Unknown') for strings, COALESCE(col, 0) for numbers.\n- Use $tablename as table placeholder.\n- Use snake_case ASCII aliases ([a-z0-9_]+ only). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n- Quote column names with spaces, e.g., 'Column Name'.\n- Include comments for complex logic or transformations.\n- For long format, use UNPIVOT or UNION ALL to transform multiple measures into a single measure column with a type column.\n- Include identifier and context columns as 'detail' fields (unlimited), balancing analytical value with interactive utility.\n- **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data, include it as a 'detail' field with alias 'url'. Only derive URLs when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid (e.g., combining base_url + path, 'https://api.domain.com/items/' + id, 'https://github.com/' + username), (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value for linking to external resources, profiles, or documentation, and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Use string concatenation or CONCAT() function. Skip if uncertain about URL validity or no clear opportunity exists.\n- **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries returning individual records (no GROUP BY/aggregation), include related contextual fields as 'detail' role, even if not explicitly requested: prioritize LOW-CARDINALITY categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department) and TEMPORAL fields (created_date, modified_date, month, day_of_week) from the original dataset. These enhance interactive exploration, cross-filtering, and tooltips without counting toward the 5-column analytical limit. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries, do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this breaks aggregation logic.\n- **ULTRA-SHORT LABELS**: Use the shortest possible human-readable labels (1–2 words preferred) for projected columns to optimize axis/legend readability.\n2. `provenance` (ViewProvenance): COMPLETE provenance metadata documenting the lineage of every field in the generated view.\nFor each field in the 'fields' list, the 'description' MUST be factually accurate and reference the exact source field ID(s) from the original dataset.\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [source_field_id] used without modification'.\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [source_field_id]: [exact_computation_performed]'.\nExamples: 'Original field customer_name used without modification', 'Derived from sales_amount: Sum aggregated by product_category',\n'Derived from customer_name: Direct selection with TRIM() applied', 'Derived from order_date: Extracted year component using EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)'.\nThis documentation ensures full accountability and traceability for derived data.\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## table_summary ## ]]\n{table_summary}\n\n[[ ## analytical_goal ## ]]\n{analytical_goal}\n\n[[ ## sql ## ]]\n{sql}\n\n[[ ## provenance ## ]]\n{provenance}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {\"type\": \"object\", \"$defs\": {\"GeneratedField\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"description\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"FACTUAL and ACCOUNTABLE lineage description that provides complete derivation transparency.\\nMust explicitly reference the original source field ID(s) from the dataset and describe the exact computational steps taken.\\nFor fields used without transformation, format as: 'Original field [original_field_name] used without modification'.\\nFor transformed/derived fields, format as: 'Derived from [original_field_name]: [exact computation/transformation performed]'.\\nFor aggregated fields, specify the aggregation function and grouping.\\nFor transformed fields, detail the transformation logic.\\nUsers must be able to trace back to the source data and understand exactly what they are looking at.\\nAvoid vague terms - be precise about operations, filters, and calculations applied.\", \"title\": \"Description\"}, \"label\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Human-friendly, whitespace separated label of this field, as it should appear in visualizations.\\nPrefer a single-word label whenever possible; otherwise choose the shortest phrasing that remains clear and descriptive.\\nAXIS READABILITY: Keep labels AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE (ideally 1–2 words) so they fit on axes and legends without truncation.\\nLabels will be quoted verbatim in downstream report text, so they must read naturally and flow with surrounding prose.\\nSTRICT LABELING: Use only standard English ASCII characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9 and spaces).

Produces clean, scalar output optimized for charts and dashboards.\n        \n        **CRITICAL RULES:**\n        1. Output ONLY scalar columns (TEXT, INTEGER, DECIMAL, DATE, TIMESTAMP) - NEVER LIST/ARRAY/STRUCT.\n        2. Maximum 5 columns for 'primary', 'segment', and 'facet' fields combined. 'Detail' fields (IDs, context) do not count toward this limit.\n        3. NO explicit rank columns (e.g., RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()) - use ORDER BY + LIMIT for rankings.\n        4. Transform booleans/codes into human-readable labels using CASE statements.\n        5. Handle nulls/empty strings with COALESCE and NULLIF for clean data.\n        6. Use snake_case for column aliases.\n        7. **MANDATORY YEAR TO DATE CONVERSION**: When a field represents a Year (either named \"Year\", \"year\", or similar year-like fields), it MUST be converted to a DATE type using `MAKE_DATE(\"Year\", 1, 1)`. This applies to any field that contains year values (e.g., 2020, 2021, etc.) regardless of its original data type. NEVER return year fields as integers or strings - always convert to proper DATE format using MAKE_DATE().\n        8. Preserve temporal types: columns with `Date`, `DateTime`, `Timestamp` semantics must remain as DuckDB temporal types, never strings or numbers.\n        8. Reduce field cardinality for visualization efficiency (e.g., bin continuous values, group rare categories).\n        9. Prefer long format over wide format to simplify downstream visualization: pivot multiple measure columns into a single measure column with a categorical column for type. For example, instead of columns `avg_type_a`, `avg_type_b`, transform into `measure_value` (quantitative) and `measure_type` (categorical, e.g., 'Type A', 'Type B') using UNPIVOT or UNION ALL.\n        10. Include unique identifier column whenever possible. When returning non-aggregated values and a PRIMARY KEY field is present in the source data, it MUST be included in the output. Additionally, include human-readable identifier columns (e.g., name, title, label fields) that provide meaningful context for data points.\n        11. In addition to the unique ID, include a name-like or human-readable identifier column (e.g., item name, product title, or customer name) to encode as a tooltip for interactive visualizations. For example, when analyzing correlations between two quantitative variables, include a nominal column (e.g., item_name) to identify data points on hover in scatter plots or similar charts.\n        12. Include additional categorical columns as 'detail' field role for NON-AGGREGATED queries, even if the analytical goal does not explicitly request them. Detail fields do not count toward the 5-column limit, so prioritize meaningful context columns for filtering, grouping, or conditional formatting (e.g., category, type, status, region fields). For AGGREGATED queries, only include 'detail' fields that are part of the GROUP BY clause or explicitly requested.\n        13. Prefer to return as many data points as possible for insightful downstream vis, e.g. if goal is to identify distribution, the more data point there is for visualization, the better.\n        14. **CRITICAL NULL HANDLING IN AGGREGATIONS**: When performing aggregations (AVG, MEAN, SUM, etc.), treat NULL values as missing data, NOT as zeros. Filter NULL values BEFORE aggregation to ensure semantic accuracy. Use WHERE clauses or FILTER expressions to exclude NULLs from calculations. For example: `AVG(column_name) FILTER (WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL)` or `WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL` in subqueries. This ensures aggregations reflect true data patterns rather than artificially inflated denominators or skewed results from implicit zero-substitution.\n        15. **MAXIMIZE CONTEXT FOR CROSS-FILTERING** (NON-AGGREGATED QUERIES ONLY): For queries that return individual records without aggregation, include additional related fields as 'detail' role fields, even if not explicitly requested. Prioritize categorical dimensions (status, type, category, region, department, etc.), temporal fields (created_date, modified_date, etc.), and descriptive fields (description, notes, tags, etc.) that enhance interactive exploration in cross-filter-enabled environments. These fields enable rich filtering, tooltips, conditional formatting, and ad-hoc analysis. 'Detail' fields don't count toward the 5-column analytical limit, so be generous with contextual information. **CRITICAL**: For AGGREGATED queries (GROUP BY, aggregate functions), do NOT add extra 'detail' fields beyond those required for grouping, as this would break the aggregation logic and produce incorrect results.\n        16. **RESPECT PROPER NOUN CASING**: NEVER output personal names, organization names, place names, product names, or titles in lowercase. Preserve original casing in SELECT outputs. Use LOWER() only for comparisons (e.g., in WHERE/ON), never for final projected columns. When normalization is required for outputs, use proper casing (e.g., INITCAP()) and avoid altering known acronyms.\n        17. **STRICT ASCII ALIASES**: All SQL column aliases must be ASCII-only snake_case using only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores ([a-z0-9_]+). No spaces, hyphens, diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols.\n        18. **STRICT ASCII LABELS**: Field labels used downstream must contain only standard English ASCII characters (letters, digits, spaces). No diacritics, emoji, or non-ASCII symbols; avoid punctuation unless essential.\n        19. **ULTRA-SHORT FIELD LABELS**: Choose the SHORTEST possible human-readable labels (ideally 1–2 words) to ensure axis/legend readability and avoid truncation in downstream visualizations.\n        20. **URL FIELD DERIVATION**: When there is a natural opportunity to derive a valid URL field from existing data (e.g., combining base URLs with paths, constructing API endpoints, building profile links from usernames, creating documentation links from identifiers), include it as a 'detail' field named 'url'. Only add URL fields when: (a) you are certain the constructed URL is valid and functional, (b) it would provide meaningful interactive value (e.g., linking to profiles, documentation, external resources), and (c) a 'url' field is not already present in the dataset. Skip URL derivation if uncertain about validity or if no clear opportunity exists.

(unclear which metric(s) and needs verification across all dimensions) \nBAD: 'Even the lowest-ranked items in this top-10 show strong performance.' (trivially obvious) \n\nCROSS-DIMENSIONAL PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n- Look for meaningful relationships between different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'High revenue items (x-position) show varied profit margins (color), suggesting different business models' \n  * 'Market leaders by volume (bar length) don't necessarily lead in growth rate (color intensity)' \n  * 'The most efficient operations (color) tend to be mid-sized rather than largest by revenue (x-position)' \n- Identify divergent patterns: items that excel in one dimension but not others \n- Note convergent patterns: items that consistently rank highly across multiple metrics \n- Avoid claiming overall superiority unless verified across ALL visible ranking dimensions \n- Describe the nature of relationships between metrics (correlation, inverse correlation, independence) \n- Focus on insights that emerge from comparing different ranking dimensions, not just describing each separately \n\nCRITICAL: TEMPORAL RANKING PATTERN ANALYSIS \n- When analyzing time-series rankings, focus on INTERESTING DISRUPTIONS and CHANGES rather than static dominance \n- Look for COMPELLING TEMPORAL NARRATIVES: \n  * Leadership changes: 'Item A led in most years but fell to third position in 2023' \n  * Performance dips: 'The consistent top performer experienced a notable decline during 2022' \n  * Recovery patterns: 'After dropping in early periods, Item B regained top-tier status by year-end' \n  * Cyclical behaviors: 'Market leader alternates between first and second position across odd/even years' \n  * Breakthrough moments: 'Item C remained mid-tier until a dramatic rise in the final two periods' \n  * Volatility vs. stability: 'While most entities show fluctuations, Item D maintains remarkably steady positioning' \n\nCRITICAL: EMERGENCE vs. VALUE CHANGE DISTINCTION IN TIME SERIES \n- NEVER confuse category emergence/disappearance with simple value increases/decreases \n- ALWAYS distinguish between these fundamentally different phenomena: \n\nEMERGENCE PATTERNS (New categories appearing): \n- 'Category X emerges in Q3 2022 as a new market segment, initially capturing modest share' \n- 'Product line Y first appears in the dataset during 2021, suggesting a product launch' \n- 'The premium tier becomes visible starting in March, indicating expansion into luxury markets' \n- 'Startup companies begin appearing in the analysis from 2023 onward' \n- DO NOT describe emergence as 'increased from zero' - it's a new entity entering the scope \n\nDISAPPEARANCE PATTERNS (Categories ceasing to exist in data): \n- 'Legacy product Z drops out of the analysis after Q2 2022, suggesting discontinuation' \n- 'The budget segment disappears from rankings mid-2023, potentially due to market exit' \n- 'Regional office presence ends abruptly in December, indicating possible closure' \n- 'Partnership category ceases to appear after March, suggesting relationship termination' \n- DO NOT describe disappearance as 'decreased to zero' - the entity exited the analytical scope \n\nVALUE CHANGE PATTERNS (Existing categories with performance shifts): \n- 'Category A shows declining performance throughout 2022 but remains present' \n- 'Product line B experiences steady growth across all visible periods' \n- 'Market share increases substantially while maintaining continuous presence' \n- 'Revenue drops significantly but entity continues operations' \n\nCRITICAL SEMANTIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS: \n- EXAMINE TEMPORAL PRESENCE: Is the category present throughout the entire visible timeframe? \n- IDENTIFY ENTRY POINTS: When does a category first become visible in the data? \n- SPOT EXIT POINTS: When does a category last appear before disappearing? \n- DISTINGUISH CAUSATION: \n  * Emergence suggests new business activity, product launches, market entry, expansion \n  * Disappearance suggests discontinuation, market exit, business closure, strategic retreat \n  * Value changes suggest performance variations within ongoing operations \n\nTEMPORAL PRESENCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- For each category/entity, is it present in ALL time periods shown? \n- If not present throughout, when does it first appear? (emergence) \n- If not present throughout, when does it last appear? (disappearance) \n- Are there gaps in presence that suggest temporary exits and re-entries? \n- Am I correctly attributing patterns to emergence/disappearance vs. performance changes? \n\nENHANCED TEMPORAL NARRATIVE EXAMPLES: \nEMERGENCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The subscription model emerges as a new revenue stream beginning in Q2 2023, quickly establishing itself among top performers.' \nGOOD: 'International markets first appear in the analysis during 2022, initially showing modest but growing contribution.' \nBAD: 'Subscription revenue increased from zero in Q2 2023.' (treats emergence as mere increase) \n\nDISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The retail partnership category disappears from rankings after Q3 2022, suggesting strategic shift away from physical stores.' \nGOOD: 'Legacy product lines cease to appear in performance metrics after March 2023, indicating portfolio rationalization.' \nBAD: 'Retail partnership revenue decreased to zero after Q3 2022.' (treats disappearance as mere decrease) \n\nVALUE CHANGE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Digital services show consistent growth across all periods while maintaining continuous market presence.' \nGOOD: 'Core product performance declines throughout 2022 but remains a significant business component.' \n\nBUSINESS CONTEXT IMPLICATIONS: \n- EMERGENCE often indicates: product launches, market expansion, new partnerships, strategic initiatives \n- DISAPPEARANCE often indicates: discontinuation, market exit, strategic refocus, business closure \n- VALUE CHANGES often indicate: performance variations, market dynamics, operational improvements/challenges \n- Frame observations with appropriate business context rather than treating all changes as mere data fluctuations \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID OVERLY BROAD TEMPORAL CLAIMS \n- NEVER make sweeping claims like 'highest performance over the entire period' unless verified for EVERY SINGLE time point \n- AVOID claims like 'consistent leader throughout' unless there are ZERO exceptions across all time periods \n- AVOID 'consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked first' - these imply ALL time periods without exception \n- AVOID 'always outperformed' unless true for EVERY visible time period without exception \n- AVOID 'never fell below' unless verified across ALL temporal data points \n- CRITICAL: 'CONSISTENTLY' = 100% OF TIME - if even ONE period shows deviation, use qualified language \n- Instead, use qualified temporal language: \n  * 'predominantly led across most periods' \n  * 'frequently achieved top position throughout the timeframe' \n  * 'generally maintained strong performance with occasional dips' \n  * 'typically ranked in the top tier, with notable exceptions in X and Y periods' \n  * 'achieved highest position in the majority of periods shown' \n  * 'regularly outperformed competitors in most periods' \n  * 'maintained leading position throughout most of the timeframe' \n\nTEMPORAL RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Have I examined EVERY time period visible in the visualization? \n- Are there any periods where my claimed pattern doesn't hold? If yes, I must qualify the statement \n- Am I focusing on interesting disruptions and changes rather than just final rankings? \n- Have I identified the most compelling temporal story (leadership changes, dips, recoveries)? \n- If claiming 'consistent' or 'always' patterns, have I verified this is true for 100% of time periods? \n- Am I using appropriately qualified language for patterns that have exceptions? \n\nCOMPELLING TEMPORAL PATTERN EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Company A dominated the first half of the period but yielded leadership to Company B after a significant dip in 2022.' \nGOOD: 'The market leader for most years experienced an unexpected drop to fourth place in 2021, before recovering to second position.' \nGOOD: 'While most competitors show volatile performance, Company C maintains steady mid-tier positioning throughout all visible periods.' \nGOOD: 'Leadership alternated between two companies until a third player emerged as the clear frontrunner in recent years.' \nBAD: 'Company A was the consistent leader throughout the entire period.' (requires verification of EVERY time point) \nBAD: 'Performance remained stable over time.' (ignores interesting disruptions and changes) \nBAD: 'Company B always outperformed Company C.' (absolute claim requiring 100% verification) \n\nCRITICAL: BOOLEAN-ACCURATE PRECISION REQUIRED \n- EVERY SINGLE OBSERVATION must be 100% factually correct with NO EXCEPTIONS \n- NEVER use absolute terms unless they are literally true for ALL visible data points WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS \n- EXTREME STRICTNESS REQUIRED: Even if 99% true, use qualified language if there's ANY exception \n- If an item was highest in 9/10 cases, DO NOT say 'consistently maintained highest' - use 'frequently achieved highest' or similar qualified language \n- For time series: 'consistently' means EVERY SINGLE time period without exception - if even one period differs, use 'generally', 'typically', 'predominantly' \n- CRITICAL WARNING: 'Consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked X' all imply PERFECT consistency across ALL time periods \n- ANY usage of 'consistently' + performance claim requires 100% verification - even ONE exception invalidates the claim \n- For categorical data: 'always' means EVERY category without exception - any single exception requires qualified language \n- If something appears 'high' compared to others, verify it's actually in the upper range, not middle range \n- WHEN IN DOUBT, ALWAYS USE QUALIFIED LANGUAGE - it's better to understate than to make false absolute claims \n- Use precise qualifiers: 'often', 'frequently', 'typically', 'generally', 'predominantly', 'mostly' instead of 'always', 'consistently', 'continuously' \n- For rankings: only use superlatives ('highest', 'lowest', 'best', 'worst') if they are literally true across the entire visible dataset \n- For trends: only say 'increasing' if there are no decreases, 'decreasing' if no increases - otherwise use 'generally increasing', 'mostly declining', etc. \n- Verify relative positions: 'high' means upper quartile, 'low' means lower quartile, 'moderate'/'mid-range' for middle values \n\nPRECISION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I prove this statement is true for 100% of visible data WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS? If no, add qualifiers \n- Are there ANY exceptions to this pattern, even minor ones? If yes, acknowledge them or use qualified language \n- Is this statement true for EVERY single data point, time period, or category shown? If not, qualify it \n- Even if 95%+ true, do I have ANY doubt about absolute accuracy? If yes, use qualified language \n- Is this truly 'high' or just 'higher than some others'? Use appropriate relative terms \n- Would this statement pass a fact-checker examining every data point with a magnifying glass? If no, revise \n- Does this observation add genuine insight or is it trivially obvious? If trivial, omit it \n- DEFAULT TO QUALIFIED LANGUAGE when there's the slightest uncertainty about absolute claims \n\nCRITICAL: CONTEXTUALIZE WITH ANALYTICAL GOAL AND DATASET DOMAIN \n- ALWAYS consider the input 'goal' to provide appropriate context for observations \n- Use the 'dataset_summary' to understand the domain context and field meanings \n- Frame observations in terms relevant to the specific business/research domain \n- If showing rankings (e.g., top-10), acknowledge that 'lowest-ranked' items are still among the global tops \n- If showing subsets or filtered data, clarify the scope (e.g., 'among premium customers', 'within the technology sector') \n- Frame observations relative to the analytical intent, not just absolute patterns \n- Provide context that helps readers understand the significance within the goal's scope \n- Connect patterns to domain-specific implications when possible \n\nCRITICAL: FAIR AND PEDANTIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS \n- When comparing groups, categories, or time periods with different sample sizes, ALWAYS acknowledge potential confounding factors \n- If one category has significantly fewer data points, note this limitation explicitly \n- Use qualifying language for comparisons involving unequal sample sizes: 'though this comparison should be interpreted cautiously given the smaller sample size' \n- Be extremely fair in analysis - don't let impressive patterns from small samples mislead readers \n- Acknowledge when statistical significance may be questionable due to sample size differences \n- For time-based comparisons, note if certain periods have less data coverage \n- For categorical comparisons, mention when certain groups are underrepresented \n- Examples of fair comparative language: \n  * 'While X appears to outperform Y, this pattern should be interpreted cautiously as X represents a much smaller sample' \n  * 'Z shows promising trends, though the limited data points make this observation preliminary' \n  * 'Despite apparent differences between A and B, the unequal representation makes definitive conclusions challenging' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will spot unfair comparisons immediately and question the entire analysis \n\nCRITICAL: SEMANTIC VISUALIZATION DETAILS AND DATA QUALITY INSIGHTS \n- ACTIVELY LOOK FOR and comment on data quality indicators visible in the visualization: \n  * Missing time periods: 'Data coverage shows gaps in Q2 and Q3, with analysis resuming in Q4' \n  * Sparse categories: 'Limited representation in the premium segment makes those patterns preliminary' \n  * Truncated data: 'The analysis period ends abruptly in March, potentially missing seasonal patterns' \n  * Uneven sampling: 'Eastern regions show denser data points compared to western territories' \n  * Cutoff thresholds: 'Only categories with substantial volume appear, potentially excluding emerging segments' \n  * Recent data emphasis: 'Most data concentrates in recent years, with limited historical context' \n\n- IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS visualization-specific semantic details: \n  * For rankings: Comment on selection criteria ('among companies with >$1M revenue', 'top 15 by market cap') \n  * For time series: Note temporal scope and gaps ('quarterly data from 2020-2023 with 2021 Q2 missing') \n  * For time series categories: DISTINGUISH emergence/disappearance from value changes \n    - 'Category X emerges mid-timeline as a new business segment' vs. 'Category Y shows declining values but maintains presence' \n    - 'Product line disappears after Q3, suggesting discontinuation' vs. 'Product line performance drops significantly' \n  * For geographic data: Acknowledge coverage limitations ('analysis covers major metropolitan areas only') \n  * For categorical breakdowns: Mention representation balance ('technology sector dominates with 60% of entities') \n  * For filtered views: Clarify scope boundaries ('within the premium pricing tier', 'excluding pilot programs') \n\n- ENHANCE INSIGHTS through contextual awareness: \n  * Data recency: 'Recent quarters show different patterns, though limited historical data makes trend assessment challenging' \n  * Sample composition: 'The dataset skews toward larger organizations, potentially missing small business dynamics' \n  * Measurement periods: 'Annual aggregation may obscure seasonal variations visible in monthly data' \n  * Selection effects: 'Focus on top performers may not reflect broader market conditions' \n\nCRITICAL: MAXIMIZE INSIGHT COMMUNICATION ACROSS ALL VISUALIZATION TYPES \n- FOR EVERY VISUALIZATION TYPE, look beyond surface patterns to extract maximum valuable insights: \n\n- BAR CHARTS: Look for clustering, gaps between bars, proportional relationships, outliers relative to the group \n- LINE CHARTS: Identify inflection points, rate changes, cyclical patterns, volatility differences, trend reversals \n  * CRITICAL: Distinguish between line emergence/disappearance vs. value changes \n  * Note when new lines appear mid-timeline (category emergence) vs. existing lines reaching zero (value decline) \n  * Identify when lines disappear from the chart (category exit) vs. lines dropping to low values (performance decline) \n  * Comment on partial timeline presence: 'Category X appears only in recent periods' vs. 'Category Y shows declining trend throughout' \n- SCATTER PLOTS: Examine correlation strength, outlier patterns, cluster formations, relationship linearity \n- HEATMAPS: Note intensity gradients, cold/hot spot patterns, diagonal trends, missing value patterns \n- PIE/DONUT CHARTS: Discuss dominance patterns, fragmentation levels, concentration vs. distribution \n- TREEMAPS: Analyze hierarchical patterns, size vs. performance relationships, nested category insights \n- BOX PLOTS: Comment on spread differences, outlier distributions, median relationships, skewness patterns \n- HISTOGRAMS: Identify distribution shapes, modal patterns, tail behaviors, concentration points \n\n- CROSS-VISUALIZATION INSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Compare patterns across multiple charts when visible simultaneously \n  * Note how different visualization methods reveal complementary aspects of the data \n  * Identify insights that emerge only when viewing multiple related visualizations together \n  * Comment on how different aggregation levels or filtering reveal different stories \n\n- ADVANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION: \n  * Threshold effects: 'Performance changes dramatically above the $10M revenue threshold' \n  * Maturity curves: 'Newer entities show higher growth volatility compared to established players' \n  * Saturation patterns: 'Market share gains slow significantly after reaching 15% penetration' \n  * Interaction effects: 'Regional patterns vary significantly by product category' \n  * Lifecycle stages: 'Different performance profiles emerge across business maturity phases' \n\n- STRATEGIC INSIGHT EXTRACTION: \n  * Competitive positioning: How entities compare across multiple performance dimensions \n  * Market dynamics: Evidence of consolidation, fragmentation, or competitive shifts \n  * Opportunity identification: Gaps, underserved segments, or emerging trends \n  * Risk indicators: Volatility patterns, concentration risks, or performance deterioration \n  * Operational insights: Efficiency patterns, scale relationships, or resource allocation implications \n\nCRITICAL: FOCUS ON OBSERVATIONS, NOT THE CHART ITSELF \n- NEVER say 'The chart shows...', 'The visualization displays...', 'The graph reveals...' \n- NEVER refer to 'the chart', 'the visualization', 'the graph', 'the figure' \n- Write about the DATA PATTERNS directly, as if observing the phenomenon itself \n- Treat findings as direct observations of the business/domain reality \n\nMANDATORY FIELD COVERAGE: \n- EXPLICITLY mention EVERY field visible in the visualization \n- Reference ALL dimensions, measures, and categorical variables shown \n- Use natural transitions to connect field relationships \n- Create smooth, flowing sentences that don't sound robotic \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID CONCRETE DATA POINTS \n- NEVER quote specific numbers, percentages, or values unless 100% certain \n- Focus on trends, relationships, and patterns instead \n- Use qualitative descriptors with appropriate precision: 'higher', 'lower', 'increasing', 'declining' \n- Better to describe direction than exact magnitude \n\nQUALIFIED LANGUAGE EXAMPLES: \n- Instead of 'consistently maintained highest': 'frequently achieved highest', 'typically ranked highest', 'generally performed best', 'predominantly held the top position' \n- Instead of 'consistently leading': 'frequently leading', 'typically in the lead', 'generally outperforming competitors', 'predominantly holding first position' \n- Instead of 'consistently outperforming': 'regularly outperforming', 'typically exceeding', 'frequently surpassing', 'generally achieving superior results' \n- Instead of 'always increasing': 'predominantly increasing', 'showing upward trend overall', 'generally rising', 'mostly trending upward' \n- Instead of 'continuously outperformed': 'regularly outperformed', 'typically exceeded', 'generally surpassed' \n- Instead of 'invariably showed': 'commonly showed', 'usually demonstrated', 'typically exhibited' \n- Instead of 'high performance': 'above-average performance', 'upper-tier performance', 'strong relative performance' \n- Instead of 'low values': 'below-median values', 'lower-quartile values', 'relatively modest values' \n- Use 'most', 'majority', 'primarily', 'largely' when patterns have exceptions \n- Use 'tends to', 'appears to', 'generally shows', 'commonly exhibits' for qualified observations \n- For time series with near-perfect patterns: 'maintained top position in nearly all periods', 'achieved highest values throughout most timeframes' \n- TEMPORAL QUALIFICATION EXAMPLES: \n  * Instead of 'consistently led throughout the entire period': 'led in most periods', 'dominated the majority of timeframes', 'held leadership for most of the visible period' \n  * Instead of 'consistently leading the market': 'frequently leading the market', 'typically holding market leadership', 'generally maintaining the top position' \n  * Instead of 'consistently outperforming all competitors': 'regularly outperforming most competitors', 'frequently achieving superior performance relative to competitors' \n  * Instead of 'never dropped below second': 'rarely fell below second place', 'typically maintained top-tier positioning' \n  * Instead of 'consistent upward trend': 'generally increasing trend with some fluctuations', 'predominantly upward movement' \n  * Instead of 'always outperformed competitors': 'regularly outperformed most competitors', 'frequently achieved superior performance' \n  * Instead of 'stable performance over time': 'relatively stable with occasional variations', 'maintained steady positioning in most periods' \n- REMEMBER: Even 95% consistency requires qualified language - absolute terms are reserved for 100% perfect patterns only \n\nHUMAN-LIKE FLOW PRINCIPLES: \n- Write with natural sentence rhythm and variety \n- Use connecting words: 'while', 'whereas', 'although', 'particularly' \n- Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony \n- Sound like a knowledgeable analyst explaining to a colleague \n- Maintain conversational yet professional tone \n\nOBJECTIVITY PRINCIPLES: \n- Be factual and conservative in claims \n- Avoid superlatives and overstated language \n- NO words like 'comprehensive', 'extensive', 'dramatic', 'significant' \n- Use neutral descriptors: 'shows variation', 'differs across', 'changes over time' \n- Underpromise, overdeliver - let the data speak for itself \n- When in doubt about precision, use more qualified language rather than absolute claims \n\nRESPECTFUL, PEOPLE-FIRST LANGUAGE: \n- Always use respectful, people-first, non-judgmental language—especially for data about human life, health, work, income, education, safety, or communities \n- Never stereotype, dehumanize, moralize, blame, or shame any group or individual \n- Describe patterns without implying intent, cause, or value judgments about people or groups \n- Prefer neutral terms (e.g., 'people', 'participants', 'workers', 'residents') over labels that could stigmatize \n- Do not reference protected characteristics unless clearly presented in the data and necessary for understanding \n- Emphasize aggregate patterns and trends; avoid implying anything about specific individuals \n- Avoid sensational or alarming phrasing; keep tone calm, considerate, and inclusive \n- If disparities appear, describe them factually without implying deficiency or fault \n\nPRIVACY AND SENSITIVITY: \n- Do not speculate about personal causes or motivations \n- Do not mention specific individuals or uniquely identifying details \n- Use careful framing for sensitive outcomes to prevent offense or harm \n\nDOMAIN-AWARE CONTEXTUALIZATION PRINCIPLES: \n- Leverage the 'dataset_summary' to understand what each field represents in the real world \n- Translate technical field names into domain-meaningful concepts for readers \n- Consider the business/research context when interpreting patterns \n- Connect observations to domain-specific implications (e.g., seasonal business cycles, customer behavior patterns, market dynamics) \n- Use domain-appropriate terminology while keeping language accessible \n- Explain why patterns matter in the context of the specific dataset domain \n- Reference the analytical 'goal' to ensure observations serve the intended purpose \n- Help readers understand not just what the data shows, but why it's significant in this domain \n\nCONTEXTUALIZATION EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN: \n- Sales data: 'Revenue patterns suggest seasonal buying behaviors typical in retail markets' \n- Healthcare data: 'Patient outcomes vary across treatment protocols in ways that align with clinical expectations' \n- Educational data: 'Student performance shows variations that correspond to known factors in academic achievement' \n- Financial data: 'Risk metrics demonstrate patterns consistent with market volatility principles' \n\nCONTENT APPROACH: \n- Describe visible trends and relationships between ALL fields with domain context \n- Note how each dimension interacts with others in ways meaningful to the dataset domain \n- Identify observable patterns across all visible variables and their domain significance \n- Create narrative flow connecting all elements within the analytical goal framework \n- Stay strictly to what's visually apparent while providing domain-relevant interpretation \n- Use dataset_summary to inform field interpretation and domain-appropriate language \n\nENHANCED CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS: \n- ALWAYS examine visualizations for non-obvious insights beyond first-glance patterns \n- Look for SECONDARY PATTERNS that might be easily missed: \n  * Subtle inflection points in trends \n  * Non-linear relationships between variables \n  * Clustering or grouping effects within categories \n  * Proportional relationships that reveal efficiency or productivity insights \n  * Variance patterns that indicate stability or volatility differences \n\n- CONTEXTUAL STORYTELLING OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Connect patterns to likely business or domain explanations \n  * Note seasonal, cyclical, or structural factors that might explain patterns \n  * Identify performance tiers, segments, or natural groupings \n  * Discuss scale effects, maturity relationships, or competitive dynamics \n  * Comment on data quality indicators that affect interpretation confidence \n\n- MAXIMIZE VALUE EXTRACTION from each visualization: \n  * Don't just describe what's visible - explain what it might mean \n  * Identify the most interesting or counter-intuitive findings \n  * Note patterns that could inform strategic decisions or operational improvements \n  * Comment on outliers or anomalies that merit further investigation \n  * Discuss implications for stakeholders in the relevant domain \n\n- COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n  * Distribution characteristics: concentration, spread, skewness, multimodality \n  * Relationship patterns: correlation strength, linearity, interaction effects \n  * Temporal dynamics: trend directions, volatility, cyclical patterns, structural breaks \n  * Categorical differences: between-group variations, within-group consistency \n  * Hierarchical insights: how patterns change across different aggregation levels \n\nFIELD MARKUP: \n- Mark human-readable field labels: <span class=\"data-field\">Field Label</span> \n- Apply ONLY to the FIRST mention of each field - avoid repetitive span markup \n- After introducing a field with span markup, refer to it naturally without spans \n- EVERY field visible must be mentioned, but only wrapped in spans on first reference \n- NO technical notation (variable_names, snake_case, CamelCase) \n\nDATA VALUE MARKUP: \n- Mark explicit data values: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"SourceField\">Actual Value</span> \n- ALWAYS include data-field attribute pointing to the source field \n- Use human-readable field names in data-field attribute \n- NEVER add quotes or other glyphs around data values \n- Apply to specific categories, time periods, product names, etc. \n\nMARKUP EXAMPLES: \n- Field reference: <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> \n- Category value: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> \n- Time period: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q3 2024</span> \n- Product name: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> \n\nGOOD EXAMPLES (Direct observation style with domain contextualization and boolean precision): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> varies across different <span class=\"data-field\">Region</span>s, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> frequently showing above-average performance while customer acquisition demonstrates seasonal fluctuations most notably in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Time Period\">Q4</span>, aligning with typical retail holiday patterns.' \n'Among the top-performing <span class=\"data-field\">Product Category</span> segments, <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Category\">Electronics</span> tends to achieve the strongest <span class=\"data-field\">Sales Performance</span>, while even the lowest-ranked category in this subset maintains substantial market presence, suggesting a healthy product portfolio diversification.' \n'Within the <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Customer Segment\">Enterprise</span> segment, <span class=\"data-field\">Monthly Revenue</span> from <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> shows predominantly upward movement throughout most of the analysis period, indicating successful market penetration in high-value accounts.' \n'<span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Company\">Acme Corp</span> led <span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> rankings (x-position) in most quarters but experienced a notable decline to third place in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2023</span>, while maintaining consistently strong <span class=\"data-field\">Profit Margins</span> (color intensity) throughout all periods.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Performance Metric</span> reveals an interesting leadership shift: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product A</span> dominated early periods but yielded first position to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product B</span> following a significant dip in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2022</span>.' \n\nENHANCED EXAMPLES (Demonstrating semantic details and deeper insights): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Customer Acquisition</span> patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4</span> consistently driving peak performance, though data gaps in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2021</span> limit trend confidence during that period.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> concentration shows the top three <span class=\"data-field\">Competitors</span> controlling substantial territory, while the analysis focuses on entities exceeding $10M revenue, potentially excluding emerging players below this threshold.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Growth Rates</span> demonstrate clear maturity effects: newer <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">startups</span> exhibit higher volatility compared to established <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">10+ year</span> entities, suggesting different risk-return profiles across business lifecycles.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Regional Performance</span> varies significantly, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Western territories</span> showing limited data density compared to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern markets</span>, making western trend assessments more preliminary.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Efficiency Metrics</span> reveal an interesting threshold effect: performance improvement accelerates notably above the 15% <span class=\"data-field\">Market Penetration</span> level, suggesting scale advantages emerge at that inflection point.' \n\nTEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Product Categories</span> show interesting lifecycle patterns: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Digital Services</span> emerges as a new offering beginning in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2022</span>, while <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Legacy Hardware</span> disappears from the analysis after <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4 2021</span>, suggesting portfolio modernization.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue Streams</span> analysis reveals strategic shifts: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">Subscription Model</span> first appears mid-timeline in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2023</span> and quickly gains traction, while traditional <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">One-time Sales</span> show declining values throughout all visible periods but maintain continuous presence.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Segments</span> demonstrate different temporal dynamics: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Premium Tier</span> emerges in the dataset starting <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Month\">March 2022</span>, indicating market expansion, whereas <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Enterprise</span> maintains steady presence with fluctuating <span class=\"data-field\">Performance</span> levels.' \n\nAVOID: \n- Chart/visualization references ('The chart shows...', 'The graph displays...') \n- Specific numbers or percentages \n- Overstated claims or superlatives without qualification \n- Technical field names \n- Absolute statements that have exceptions ('always', 'never', 'consistently' when not 100% true) \n- Unqualified claims about relative position ('high' when actually mid-range) \n- Trivial observations that add no insight value \n- Obvious ranking statements ('top performers perform well', 'lowest in top-10 still strong') \n- Self-evident filtering context ('these top items show good results') \n- Unfair comparisons between groups with vastly different sample sizes without acknowledgment \n- Drawing strong conclusions from small samples without appropriate caveats \n- Robotic or repetitive phrasing \n- Missing any visible fields in the description \n- Untagged data values (always use data-value spans for explicit values) \n- Quotes or glyphs around data values \n- Repetitive span markup (only wrap field names on first mention) \n- TEMPORAL RANKING PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Consistently led throughout the entire period' (requires 100% verification across all time points) \n  * 'Consistently leading the market' (implies leadership in ALL time periods without exception) \n  * 'Consistently outperforming competitors' (absolute claim requiring verification across every time point) \n  * 'Consistently ranked first' (implies first place in ALL visible periods) \n  * 'Consistently maintained top position' (suggests unbroken leadership across entire timeframe) \n  * 'Always maintained top position' (absolute claim without acknowledging any dips or exceptions) \n  * 'Performance remained stable over time' (ignores interesting temporal disruptions and patterns) \n  * 'Never fell below second place' (absolute negative claim requiring complete verification) \n  * 'Continuous upward trend' (ignores any downward movements or fluctuations) \n  * 'Steady leadership throughout' (misses compelling stories about leadership changes or challenges) \n  * 'Uniform performance across all periods' (overlooks interesting temporal variations and anomalies) \n  * Generic statements that miss the most compelling temporal narrative (dips, recoveries, leadership shifts) \n  * REMEMBER: 'Consistently' + any performance claim = absolute assertion requiring 100% temporal verification \n\n- TEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Revenue increased from zero in Q3' when describing category emergence (should be 'Category emerges in Q3 as new business segment') \n  * 'Performance decreased to zero after March' when describing category disappearance (should be 'Category disappears after March, suggesting discontinuation') \n  * 'Category X went from 0 to significant levels' (should be 'Category X emerges mid-timeline and quickly establishes presence') \n  * Treating emergence as casual increase and disappearance as casual decrease \n  * Missing the strategic/business implications of categories entering or exiting the analysis scope \n  * Confusing data visualization artifacts with actual business phenomena \n  * Not distinguishing between 'not yet launched' and 'declining performance' \n  * Not distinguishing between 'discontinued/exited' and 'temporary poor performance'\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## goal ## ]]\n{goal}\n\n[[ ## section_title ##

Be precise and modest while maintaining human-like readability. \n\nMAXIMIZED INSIGHT EXTRACTION MANDATE: \n- Go BEYOND surface-level observations to extract maximum valuable insights from every visualization \n- Identify NON-OBVIOUS patterns, relationships, and implications that add genuine analytical value \n- Comment on DATA QUALITY indicators, sampling effects, and contextual factors that affect interpretation \n- Discuss SEMANTIC DETAILS like data gaps, cutoffs, representation imbalances, and scope limitations \n- Extract STRATEGIC INSIGHTS about competitive positioning, market dynamics, operational efficiency, or business implications \n- Note THRESHOLD EFFECTS, inflection points, clustering patterns, and other nuanced relationships \n- Balance comprehensive insight extraction with strict factual accuracy - never sacrifice truth for depth \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID TRIVIAL OBSERVATIONS \n- NEVER state obvious patterns like 'in this ranking, lower items have lower values' \n- NEVER mention self-evident facts like 'the chart contains data' or 'values vary' \n- NEVER describe basic chart mechanics like 'bars show different heights' \n- Focus ONLY on meaningful, non-obvious insights that add value \n- Better to write less than to include boring or trivial statements \n- Skip observations that any reader could immediately see without explanation \n- SILENCE IS BETTER THAN MEANINGLESS TALK - never include 'null' sentences that add no value \n\nCRITICAL: MULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING PRECISION \n- Visualizations often encode MULTIPLE ranking dimensions simultaneously (e.g., x-axis position, color intensity, bar length, size) \n- EACH visual encoding represents a SEPARATE metric and must be analyzed INDEPENDENTLY \n- NEVER assume that an item ranked #1 in one dimension is also #1 in another dimension \n- EXPLICITLY separate statements about different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'Item A leads in revenue (x-axis position) while Item B shows highest profit margin (color intensity)' \n  * 'The company with largest market share (bar length) differs from the one with strongest growth rate (color saturation)' \n- VERIFY each ranking claim against its specific visual encoding BEFORE making statements \n- When multiple metrics are present, analyze their CORRELATION or DIVERGENCE patterns \n\nCRITICAL: DIMENSION-SPECIFIC RANKING ANALYSIS \n- Identify ALL visual encodings present: position (x/y), length, area, color intensity, size, opacity, etc. \n- For EACH encoding, determine what metric it represents from dataset_summary \n- Analyze ranking patterns SEPARATELY for each metric \n- Look for RELATIONSHIPS between different ranking dimensions: \n  * Do the same items rank highly across multiple metrics? (correlation) \n  * Are top performers in one metric weak in another? (trade-offs) \n  * Is there a clear leader across all dimensions? (only if verified for ALL metrics) \n  * Are there items that excel in specific metrics but not others? (specialization) \n\nMULTI-RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I identify each visual encoding and its corresponding metric from the dataset_summary? \n- Am I making separate, verified claims about each ranking dimension? \n- If claiming an item is 'top-performing overall', have I verified it ranks highly in ALL visible metrics? \n- If discussing correlation between metrics, am I being specific about which dimensions show this pattern? \n- Am I avoiding false generalizations like 'the leader in X also leads in Y' without visual verification? \n\nINTELLIGENT RANKING NARRATION \n- When visualizing top-K rankings (e.g., top-10 products), NEVER state obvious facts about the ranking nature \n- AVOID meaningless statements like 'Even the products at the lower end of this top-10 ranking demonstrate great sales' - this is self-evident \n- AVOID 'The lowest-ranked items in this top-10 still show strong performance' - of course they do, that's why they're in the top-10 \n- Instead, focus on MEANINGFUL patterns within and across ranking dimensions: \n  * Are there clear performance tiers within each metric? \n  * Do certain items cluster together in specific dimensions? \n  * Are there notable gaps between adjacent items in particular metrics? \n  * Do any items perform unexpectedly in one metric vs. another? \n  * How does each metric vary across the ranking (steep decline, gradual, flat)? \n  * Which items show consistent performance across multiple metrics vs. metric-specific strengths? \n- Focus on the DISTRIBUTION and PATTERNS within and across rankings, not obvious facts \n- Use ranking context intelligently: 'Within this top-performing group, X leads in revenue while Y dominates in efficiency metrics' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will immediately recognize trivial ranking observations as meaningless filler \n\nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Item A leads in total sales volume (bar length) while Item C achieves the highest profit margins (color intensity), demonstrating different paths to success.' \nGOOD: 'The top revenue performer (x-axis position) ranks mid-tier in customer satisfaction (color), suggesting potential trade-offs between scale and quality.' \nGOOD: 'Performance clusters emerge differently across metrics: the top three in market share (position) scatter across the efficiency spectrum (color saturation).' \nBAD: 'The top performer excels across all metrics.' (requires verification of ALL visual dimensions) \nBAD: 'Item A is the clear leader.' (unclear which metric(s) and needs verification across all dimensions) \nBAD: 'Even the lowest-ranked items in this top-10 show strong performance.' (trivially obvious) \n\nCROSS-DIMENSIONAL PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n- Look for meaningful relationships between different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'High revenue items (x-position) show varied profit margins (color), suggesting different business models' \n  * 'Market leaders by volume (bar length) don't necessarily lead in growth rate (color intensity)' \n  * 'The most efficient operations (color) tend to be mid-sized rather than largest by revenue (x-position)' \n- Identify divergent patterns: items that excel in one dimension but not others \n- Note convergent patterns: items that consistently rank highly across multiple metrics \n- Avoid claiming overall superiority unless verified across ALL visible ranking dimensions \n- Describe the nature of relationships between metrics (correlation, inverse correlation, independence) \n- Focus on insights that emerge from comparing different ranking dimensions, not just describing each separately \n\nCRITICAL: TEMPORAL RANKING PATTERN ANALYSIS \n- When analyzing time-series rankings, focus on INTERESTING DISRUPTIONS and CHANGES rather than static dominance \n- Look for COMPELLING TEMPORAL NARRATIVES: \n  * Leadership changes: 'Item A led in most years but fell to third position in 2023' \n  * Performance dips: 'The consistent top performer experienced a notable decline during 2022' \n  * Recovery patterns: 'After dropping in early periods, Item B regained top-tier status by year-end' \n  * Cyclical behaviors: 'Market leader alternates between first and second position across odd/even years' \n  * Breakthrough moments: 'Item C remained mid-tier until a dramatic rise in the final two periods' \n  * Volatility vs. stability: 'While most entities show fluctuations, Item D maintains remarkably steady positioning' \n\nCRITICAL: EMERGENCE vs. VALUE CHANGE DISTINCTION IN TIME SERIES \n- NEVER confuse category emergence/disappearance with simple value increases/decreases \n- ALWAYS distinguish between these fundamentally different phenomena: \n\nEMERGENCE PATTERNS (New categories appearing): \n- 'Category X emerges in Q3 2022 as a new market segment, initially capturing modest share' \n- 'Product line Y first appears in the dataset during 2021, suggesting a product launch' \n- 'The premium tier becomes visible starting in March, indicating expansion into luxury markets' \n- 'Startup companies begin appearing in the analysis from 2023 onward' \n- DO NOT describe emergence as 'increased from zero' - it's a new entity entering the scope \n\nDISAPPEARANCE PATTERNS (Categories ceasing to exist in data): \n- 'Legacy product Z drops out of the analysis after Q2 2022, suggesting discontinuation' \n- 'The budget segment disappears from rankings mid-2023, potentially due to market exit' \n- 'Regional office presence ends abruptly in December, indicating possible closure' \n- 'Partnership category ceases to appear after March, suggesting relationship termination' \n- DO NOT describe disappearance as 'decreased to zero' - the entity exited the analytical scope \n\nVALUE CHANGE PATTERNS (Existing categories with performance shifts): \n- 'Category A shows declining performance throughout 2022 but remains present' \n- 'Product line B experiences steady growth across all visible periods' \n- 'Market share increases substantially while maintaining continuous presence' \n- 'Revenue drops significantly but entity continues operations' \n\nCRITICAL SEMANTIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS: \n- EXAMINE TEMPORAL PRESENCE: Is the category present throughout the entire visible timeframe? \n- IDENTIFY ENTRY POINTS: When does a category first become visible in the data? \n- SPOT EXIT POINTS: When does a category last appear before disappearing? \n- DISTINGUISH CAUSATION: \n  * Emergence suggests new business activity, product launches, market entry, expansion \n  * Disappearance suggests discontinuation, market exit, business closure, strategic retreat \n  * Value changes suggest performance variations within ongoing operations \n\nTEMPORAL PRESENCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- For each category/entity, is it present in ALL time periods shown? \n- If not present throughout, when does it first appear? (emergence) \n- If not present throughout, when does it last appear? (disappearance) \n- Are there gaps in presence that suggest temporary exits and re-entries? \n- Am I correctly attributing patterns to emergence/disappearance vs. performance changes? \n\nENHANCED TEMPORAL NARRATIVE EXAMPLES: \nEMERGENCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The subscription model emerges as a new revenue stream beginning in Q2 2023, quickly establishing itself among top performers.' \nGOOD: 'International markets first appear in the analysis during 2022, initially showing modest but growing contribution.' \nBAD: 'Subscription revenue increased from zero in Q2 2023.' (treats emergence as mere increase) \n\nDISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The retail partnership category disappears from rankings after Q3 2022, suggesting strategic shift away from physical stores.' \nGOOD: 'Legacy product lines cease to appear in performance metrics after March 2023, indicating portfolio rationalization.' \nBAD: 'Retail partnership revenue decreased to zero after Q3 2022.' (treats disappearance as mere decrease) \n\nVALUE CHANGE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Digital services show consistent growth across all periods while maintaining continuous market presence.' \nGOOD: 'Core product performance declines throughout 2022 but remains a significant business component.' \n\nBUSINESS CONTEXT IMPLICATIONS: \n- EMERGENCE often indicates: product launches, market expansion, new partnerships, strategic initiatives \n- DISAPPEARANCE often indicates: discontinuation, market exit, strategic refocus, business closure \n- VALUE CHANGES often indicate: performance variations, market dynamics, operational improvements/challenges \n- Frame observations with appropriate business context rather than treating all changes as mere data fluctuations \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID OVERLY BROAD TEMPORAL CLAIMS \n- NEVER make sweeping claims like 'highest performance over the entire period' unless verified for EVERY SINGLE time point \n- AVOID claims like 'consistent leader throughout' unless there are ZERO exceptions across all time periods \n- AVOID 'consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked first' - these imply ALL time periods without exception \n- AVOID 'always outperformed' unless true for EVERY visible time period without exception \n- AVOID 'never fell below' unless verified across ALL temporal data points \n- CRITICAL: 'CONSISTENTLY' = 100% OF TIME - if even ONE period shows deviation, use qualified language \n- Instead, use qualified temporal language: \n  * 'predominantly led across most periods' \n  * 'frequently achieved top position throughout the timeframe' \n  * 'generally maintained strong performance with occasional dips' \n  * 'typically ranked in the top tier, with notable exceptions in X and Y periods' \n  * 'achieved highest position in the majority of periods shown' \n  * 'regularly outperformed competitors in most periods' \n  * 'maintained leading position throughout most of the timeframe' \n\nTEMPORAL RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Have I examined EVERY time period visible in the visualization? \n- Are there any periods where my claimed pattern doesn't hold? If yes, I must qualify the statement \n- Am I focusing on interesting disruptions and changes rather than just final rankings? \n- Have I identified the most compelling temporal story (leadership changes, dips, recoveries)? \n- If claiming 'consistent' or 'always' patterns, have I verified this is true for 100% of time periods? \n- Am I using appropriately qualified language for patterns that have exceptions? \n\nCOMPELLING TEMPORAL PATTERN EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Company A dominated the first half of the period but yielded leadership to Company B after a significant dip in 2022.' \nGOOD: 'The market leader for most years experienced an unexpected drop to fourth place in 2021, before recovering to second position.' \nGOOD: 'While most competitors show volatile performance, Company C maintains steady mid-tier positioning throughout all visible periods.' \nGOOD: 'Leadership alternated between two companies until a third player emerged as the clear frontrunner in recent years.' \nBAD: 'Company A was the consistent leader throughout the entire period.' (requires verification of EVERY time point) \nBAD: 'Performance remained stable over time.' (ignores interesting disruptions and changes) \nBAD: 'Company B always outperformed Company C.' (absolute claim requiring 100% verification) \n\nCRITICAL: BOOLEAN-ACCURATE PRECISION REQUIRED \n- EVERY SINGLE OBSERVATION must be 100% factually correct with NO EXCEPTIONS \n- NEVER use absolute terms unless they are literally true for ALL visible data points WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS \n- EXTREME STRICTNESS REQUIRED: Even if 99% true, use qualified language if there's ANY exception \n- If an item was highest in 9/10 cases, DO NOT say 'consistently maintained highest' - use 'frequently achieved highest' or similar qualified language \n- For time series: 'consistently' means EVERY SINGLE time period without exception - if even one period differs, use 'generally', 'typically', 'predominantly' \n- CRITICAL WARNING: 'Consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked X' all imply PERFECT consistency across ALL time periods \n- ANY usage of 'consistently' + performance claim requires 100% verification - even ONE exception invalidates the claim \n- For categorical data: 'always' means EVERY category without exception - any single exception requires qualified language \n- If something appears 'high' compared to others, verify it's actually in the upper range, not middle range \n- WHEN IN DOUBT, ALWAYS USE QUALIFIED LANGUAGE - it's better to understate than to make false absolute claims \n- Use precise qualifiers: 'often', 'frequently', 'typically', 'generally', 'predominantly', 'mostly' instead of 'always', 'consistently', 'continuously' \n- For rankings: only use superlatives ('highest', 'lowest', 'best', 'worst') if they are literally true across the entire visible dataset \n- For trends: only say 'increasing' if there are no decreases, 'decreasing' if no increases - otherwise use 'generally increasing', 'mostly declining', etc. \n- Verify relative positions: 'high' means upper quartile, 'low' means lower quartile, 'moderate'/'mid-range' for middle values \n\nPRECISION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I prove this statement is true for 100% of visible data WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS? If no, add qualifiers \n- Are there ANY exceptions to this pattern, even minor ones? If yes, acknowledge them or use qualified language \n- Is this statement true for EVERY single data point, time period, or category shown? If not, qualify it \n- Even if 95%+ true, do I have ANY doubt about absolute accuracy? If yes, use qualified language \n- Is this truly 'high' or just 'higher than some others'? Use appropriate relative terms \n- Would this statement pass a fact-checker examining every data point with a magnifying glass? If no, revise \n- Does this observation add genuine insight or is it trivially obvious? If trivial, omit it \n- DEFAULT TO QUALIFIED LANGUAGE when there's the slightest uncertainty about absolute claims \n\nCRITICAL: CONTEXTUALIZE WITH ANALYTICAL GOAL AND DATASET DOMAIN \n- ALWAYS consider the input 'goal' to provide appropriate context for observations \n- Use the 'dataset_summary' to understand the domain context and field meanings \n- Frame observations in terms relevant to the specific business/research domain \n- If showing rankings (e.g., top-10), acknowledge that 'lowest-ranked' items are still among the global tops \n- If showing subsets or filtered data, clarify the scope (e.g., 'among premium customers', 'within the technology sector') \n- Frame observations relative to the analytical intent, not just absolute patterns \n- Provide context that helps readers understand the significance within the goal's scope \n- Connect patterns to domain-specific implications when possible \n\nCRITICAL: FAIR AND PEDANTIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS \n- When comparing groups, categories, or time periods with different sample sizes, ALWAYS acknowledge potential confounding factors \n- If one category has significantly fewer data points, note this limitation explicitly \n- Use qualifying language for comparisons involving unequal sample sizes: 'though this comparison should be interpreted cautiously given the smaller sample size' \n- Be extremely fair in analysis - don't let impressive patterns from small samples mislead readers \n- Acknowledge when statistical significance may be questionable due to sample size differences \n- For time-based comparisons, note if certain periods have less data coverage \n- For categorical comparisons, mention when certain groups are underrepresented \n- Examples of fair comparative language: \n  * 'While X appears to outperform Y, this pattern should be interpreted cautiously as X represents a much smaller sample' \n  * 'Z shows promising trends, though the limited data points make this observation preliminary' \n  * 'Despite apparent differences between A and B, the unequal representation makes definitive conclusions challenging' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will spot unfair comparisons immediately and question the entire analysis \n\nCRITICAL: SEMANTIC VISUALIZATION DETAILS AND DATA QUALITY INSIGHTS \n- ACTIVELY LOOK FOR and comment on data quality indicators visible in the visualization: \n  * Missing time periods: 'Data coverage shows gaps in Q2 and Q3, with analysis resuming in Q4' \n  * Sparse categories: 'Limited representation in the premium segment makes those patterns preliminary' \n  * Truncated data: 'The analysis period ends abruptly in March, potentially missing seasonal patterns' \n  * Uneven sampling: 'Eastern regions show denser data points compared to western territories' \n  * Cutoff thresholds: 'Only categories with substantial volume appear, potentially excluding emerging segments' \n  * Recent data emphasis: 'Most data concentrates in recent years, with limited historical context' \n\n- IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS visualization-specific semantic details: \n  * For rankings: Comment on selection criteria ('among companies with >$1M revenue', 'top 15 by market cap') \n  * For time series: Note temporal scope and gaps ('quarterly data from 2020-2023 with 2021 Q2 missing') \n  * For time series categories: DISTINGUISH emergence/disappearance from value changes \n    - 'Category X emerges mid-timeline as a new business segment' vs. 'Category Y shows declining values but maintains presence' \n    - 'Product line disappears after Q3, suggesting discontinuation' vs. 'Product line performance drops significantly' \n  * For geographic data: Acknowledge coverage limitations ('analysis covers major metropolitan areas only') \n  * For categorical breakdowns: Mention representation balance ('technology sector dominates with 60% of entities') \n  * For filtered views: Clarify scope boundaries ('within the premium pricing tier', 'excluding pilot programs') \n\n- ENHANCE INSIGHTS through contextual awareness: \n  * Data recency: 'Recent quarters show different patterns, though limited historical data makes trend assessment challenging' \n  * Sample composition: 'The dataset skews toward larger organizations, potentially missing small business dynamics' \n  * Measurement periods: 'Annual aggregation may obscure seasonal variations visible in monthly data' \n  * Selection effects: 'Focus on top performers may not reflect broader market conditions' \n\nCRITICAL: MAXIMIZE INSIGHT COMMUNICATION ACROSS ALL VISUALIZATION TYPES \n- FOR EVERY VISUALIZATION TYPE, look beyond surface patterns to extract maximum valuable insights: \n\n- BAR CHARTS: Look for clustering, gaps between bars, proportional relationships, outliers relative to the group \n- LINE CHARTS: Identify inflection points, rate changes, cyclical patterns, volatility differences, trend reversals \n  * CRITICAL: Distinguish between line emergence/disappearance vs. value changes \n  * Note when new lines appear mid-timeline (category emergence) vs. existing lines reaching zero (value decline) \n  * Identify when lines disappear from the chart (category exit) vs. lines dropping to low values (performance decline) \n  * Comment on partial timeline presence: 'Category X appears only in recent periods' vs. 'Category Y shows declining trend throughout' \n- SCATTER PLOTS: Examine correlation strength, outlier patterns, cluster formations, relationship linearity \n- HEATMAPS: Note intensity gradients, cold/hot spot patterns, diagonal trends, missing value patterns \n- PIE/DONUT CHARTS: Discuss dominance patterns, fragmentation levels, concentration vs. distribution \n- TREEMAPS: Analyze hierarchical patterns, size vs. performance relationships, nested category insights \n- BOX PLOTS: Comment on spread differences, outlier distributions, median relationships, skewness patterns \n- HISTOGRAMS: Identify distribution shapes, modal patterns, tail behaviors, concentration points \n\n- CROSS-VISUALIZATION INSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Compare patterns across multiple charts when visible simultaneously \n  * Note how different visualization methods reveal complementary aspects of the data \n  * Identify insights that emerge only when viewing multiple related visualizations together \n  * Comment on how different aggregation levels or filtering reveal different stories \n\n- ADVANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION: \n  * Threshold effects: 'Performance changes dramatically above the $10M revenue threshold' \n  * Maturity curves: 'Newer entities show higher growth volatility compared to established players' \n  * Saturation patterns: 'Market share gains slow significantly after reaching 15% penetration' \n  * Interaction effects: 'Regional patterns vary significantly by product category' \n  * Lifecycle stages: 'Different performance profiles emerge across business maturity phases' \n\n- STRATEGIC INSIGHT EXTRACTION: \n  * Competitive positioning: How entities compare across multiple performance dimensions \n  * Market dynamics: Evidence of consolidation, fragmentation, or competitive shifts \n  * Opportunity identification: Gaps, underserved segments, or emerging trends \n  * Risk indicators: Volatility patterns, concentration risks, or performance deterioration \n  * Operational insights: Efficiency patterns, scale relationships, or resource allocation implications \n\nCRITICAL: FOCUS ON OBSERVATIONS, NOT THE CHART ITSELF \n- NEVER say 'The chart shows...', 'The visualization displays...', 'The graph reveals...' \n- NEVER refer to 'the chart', 'the visualization', 'the graph', 'the figure' \n- Write about the DATA PATTERNS directly, as if observing the phenomenon itself \n- Treat findings as direct observations of the business/domain reality \n\nMANDATORY FIELD COVERAGE: \n- EXPLICITLY mention EVERY field visible in the visualization \n- Reference ALL dimensions, measures, and categorical variables shown \n- Use natural transitions to connect field relationships \n- Create smooth, flowing sentences that don't sound robotic \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID CONCRETE DATA POINTS \n- NEVER quote specific numbers, percentages, or values unless 100% certain \n- Focus on trends, relationships, and patterns instead \n- Use qualitative descriptors with appropriate precision: 'higher', 'lower', 'increasing', 'declining' \n- Better to describe direction than exact magnitude \n\nQUALIFIED LANGUAGE EXAMPLES: \n- Instead of 'consistently maintained highest': 'frequently achieved highest', 'typically ranked highest', 'generally performed best', 'predominantly held the top position' \n- Instead of 'consistently leading': 'frequently leading', 'typically in the lead', 'generally outperforming competitors', 'predominantly holding first position' \n- Instead of 'consistently outperforming': 'regularly outperforming', 'typically exceeding', 'frequently surpassing', 'generally achieving superior results' \n- Instead of 'always increasing': 'predominantly increasing', 'showing upward trend overall', 'generally rising', 'mostly trending upward' \n- Instead of 'continuously outperformed': 'regularly outperformed', 'typically exceeded', 'generally surpassed' \n- Instead of 'invariably showed': 'commonly showed', 'usually demonstrated', 'typically exhibited' \n- Instead of 'high performance': 'above-average performance', 'upper-tier performance', 'strong relative performance' \n- Instead of 'low values': 'below-median values', 'lower-quartile values', 'relatively modest values' \n- Use 'most', 'majority', 'primarily', 'largely' when patterns have exceptions \n- Use 'tends to', 'appears to', 'generally shows', 'commonly exhibits' for qualified observations \n- For time series with near-perfect patterns: 'maintained top position in nearly all periods', 'achieved highest values throughout most timeframes' \n- TEMPORAL QUALIFICATION EXAMPLES: \n  * Instead of 'consistently led throughout the entire period': 'led in most periods', 'dominated the majority of timeframes', 'held leadership for most of the visible period' \n  * Instead of 'consistently leading the market': 'frequently leading the market', 'typically holding market leadership', 'generally maintaining the top position' \n  * Instead of 'consistently outperforming all competitors': 'regularly outperforming most competitors', 'frequently achieving superior performance relative to competitors' \n  * Instead of 'never dropped below second': 'rarely fell below second place', 'typically maintained top-tier positioning' \n  * Instead of 'consistent upward trend': 'generally increasing trend with some fluctuations', 'predominantly upward movement' \n  * Instead of 'always outperformed competitors': 'regularly outperformed most competitors', 'frequently achieved superior performance' \n  * Instead of 'stable performance over time': 'relatively stable with occasional variations', 'maintained steady positioning in most periods' \n- REMEMBER: Even 95% consistency requires qualified language - absolute terms are reserved for 100% perfect patterns only \n\nHUMAN-LIKE FLOW PRINCIPLES: \n- Write with natural sentence rhythm and variety \n- Use connecting words: 'while', 'whereas', 'although', 'particularly' \n- Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony \n- Sound like a knowledgeable analyst explaining to a colleague \n- Maintain conversational yet professional tone \n\nOBJECTIVITY PRINCIPLES: \n- Be factual and conservative in claims \n- Avoid superlatives and overstated language \n- NO words like 'comprehensive', 'extensive', 'dramatic', 'significant' \n- Use neutral descriptors: 'shows variation', 'differs across', 'changes over time' \n- Underpromise, overdeliver - let the data speak for itself \n- When in doubt about precision, use more qualified language rather than absolute claims \n\nRESPECTFUL, PEOPLE-FIRST LANGUAGE: \n- Always use respectful, people-first, non-judgmental language—especially for data about human life, health, work, income, education, safety, or communities \n- Never stereotype, dehumanize, moralize, blame, or shame any group or individual \n- Describe patterns without implying intent, cause, or value judgments about people or groups \n- Prefer neutral terms (e.g., 'people', 'participants', 'workers', 'residents') over labels that could stigmatize \n- Do not reference protected characteristics unless clearly presented in the data and necessary for understanding \n- Emphasize aggregate patterns and trends; avoid implying anything about specific individuals \n- Avoid sensational or alarming phrasing; keep tone calm, considerate, and inclusive \n- If disparities appear, describe them factually without implying deficiency or fault \n\nPRIVACY AND SENSITIVITY: \n- Do not speculate about personal causes or motivations \n- Do not mention specific individuals or uniquely identifying details \n- Use careful framing for sensitive outcomes to prevent offense or harm \n\nDOMAIN-AWARE CONTEXTUALIZATION PRINCIPLES: \n- Leverage the 'dataset_summary' to understand what each field represents in the real world \n- Translate technical field names into domain-meaningful concepts for readers \n- Consider the business/research context when interpreting patterns \n- Connect observations to domain-specific implications (e.g., seasonal business cycles, customer behavior patterns, market dynamics) \n- Use domain-appropriate terminology while keeping language accessible \n- Explain why patterns matter in the context of the specific dataset domain \n- Reference the analytical 'goal' to ensure observations serve the intended purpose \n- Help readers understand not just what the data shows, but why it's significant in this domain \n\nCONTEXTUALIZATION EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN: \n- Sales data: 'Revenue patterns suggest seasonal buying behaviors typical in retail markets' \n- Healthcare data: 'Patient outcomes vary across treatment protocols in ways that align with clinical expectations' \n- Educational data: 'Student performance shows variations that correspond to known factors in academic achievement' \n- Financial data: 'Risk metrics demonstrate patterns consistent with market volatility principles' \n\nCONTENT APPROACH: \n- Describe visible trends and relationships between ALL fields with domain context \n- Note how each dimension interacts with others in ways meaningful to the dataset domain \n- Identify observable patterns across all visible variables and their domain significance \n- Create narrative flow connecting all elements within the analytical goal framework \n- Stay strictly to what's visually apparent while providing domain-relevant interpretation \n- Use dataset_summary to inform field interpretation and domain-appropriate language \n\nENHANCED CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS: \n- ALWAYS examine visualizations for non-obvious insights beyond first-glance patterns \n- Look for SECONDARY PATTERNS that might be easily missed: \n  * Subtle inflection points in trends \n  * Non-linear relationships between variables \n  * Clustering or grouping effects within categories \n  * Proportional relationships that reveal efficiency or productivity insights \n  * Variance patterns that indicate stability or volatility differences \n\n- CONTEXTUAL STORYTELLING OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Connect patterns to likely business or domain explanations \n  * Note seasonal, cyclical, or structural factors that might explain patterns \n  * Identify performance tiers, segments, or natural groupings \n  * Discuss scale effects, maturity relationships, or competitive dynamics \n  * Comment on data quality indicators that affect interpretation confidence \n\n- MAXIMIZE VALUE EXTRACTION from each visualization: \n  * Don't just describe what's visible - explain what it might mean \n  * Identify the most interesting or counter-intuitive findings \n  * Note patterns that could inform strategic decisions or operational improvements \n  * Comment on outliers or anomalies that merit further investigation \n  * Discuss implications for stakeholders in the relevant domain \n\n- COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n  * Distribution characteristics: concentration, spread, skewness, multimodality \n  * Relationship patterns: correlation strength, linearity, interaction effects \n  * Temporal dynamics: trend directions, volatility, cyclical patterns, structural breaks \n  * Categorical differences: between-group variations, within-group consistency \n  * Hierarchical insights: how patterns change across different aggregation levels \n\nFIELD MARKUP: \n- Mark human-readable field labels: <span class=\"data-field\">Field Label</span> \n- Apply ONLY to the FIRST mention of each field - avoid repetitive span markup \n- After introducing a field with span markup, refer to it naturally without spans \n- EVERY field visible must be mentioned, but only wrapped in spans on first reference \n- NO technical notation (variable_names, snake_case, CamelCase) \n\nDATA VALUE MARKUP: \n- Mark explicit data values: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"SourceField\">Actual Value</span> \n- ALWAYS include data-field attribute pointing to the source field \n- Use human-readable field names in data-field attribute \n- NEVER add quotes or other glyphs around data values \n- Apply to specific categories, time periods, product names, etc. \n\nMARKUP EXAMPLES: \n- Field reference: <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> \n- Category value: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> \n- Time period: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q3 2024</span> \n- Product name: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> \n\nGOOD EXAMPLES (Direct observation style with domain contextualization and boolean precision): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> varies across different <span class=\"data-field\">Region</span>s, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> frequently showing above-average performance while customer acquisition demonstrates seasonal fluctuations most notably in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Time Period\">Q4</span>, aligning with typical retail holiday patterns.' \n'Among the top-performing <span class=\"data-field\">Product Category</span> segments, <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Category\">Electronics</span> tends to achieve the strongest <span class=\"data-field\">Sales Performance</span>, while even the lowest-ranked category in this subset maintains substantial market presence, suggesting a healthy product portfolio diversification.' \n'Within the <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Customer Segment\">Enterprise</span> segment, <span class=\"data-field\">Monthly Revenue</span> from <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> shows predominantly upward movement throughout most of the analysis period, indicating successful market penetration in high-value accounts.' \n'<span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Company\">Acme Corp</span> led <span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> rankings (x-position) in most quarters but experienced a notable decline to third place in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2023</span>, while maintaining consistently strong <span class=\"data-field\">Profit Margins</span> (color intensity) throughout all periods.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Performance Metric</span> reveals an interesting leadership shift: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product A</span> dominated early periods but yielded first position to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product B</span> following a significant dip in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2022</span>.' \n\nENHANCED EXAMPLES (Demonstrating semantic details and deeper insights): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Customer Acquisition</span> patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4</span> consistently driving peak performance, though data gaps in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2021</span> limit trend confidence during that period.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> concentration shows the top three <span class=\"data-field\">Competitors</span> controlling substantial territory, while the analysis focuses on entities exceeding $10M revenue, potentially excluding emerging players below this threshold.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Growth Rates</span> demonstrate clear maturity effects: newer <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">startups</span> exhibit higher volatility compared to established <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">10+ year</span> entities, suggesting different risk-return profiles across business lifecycles.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Regional Performance</span> varies significantly, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Western territories</span> showing limited data density compared to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern markets</span>, making western trend assessments more preliminary.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Efficiency Metrics</span> reveal an interesting threshold effect: performance improvement accelerates notably above the 15% <span class=\"data-field\">Market Penetration</span> level, suggesting scale advantages emerge at that inflection point.' \n\nTEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Product Categories</span> show interesting lifecycle patterns: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Digital Services</span> emerges as a new offering beginning in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2022</span>, while <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Legacy Hardware</span> disappears from the analysis after <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4 2021</span>, suggesting portfolio modernization.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue Streams</span> analysis reveals strategic shifts: <span

Overstated claims or superlatives without qualification \n- Technical field names \n- Absolute statements that have exceptions ('always', 'never', 'consistently' when not 100% true) \n- Unqualified claims about relative position ('high' when actually mid-range) \n- Trivial observations that add no insight value \n- Obvious ranking statements ('top performers perform well', 'lowest in top-10 still strong') \n- Self-evident filtering context ('these top items show good results') \n- Unfair comparisons between groups with vastly different sample sizes without acknowledgment \n- Drawing strong conclusions from small samples without appropriate caveats \n- Robotic or repetitive phrasing \n- Missing any visible fields in the description \n- Untagged data values (always use data-value spans for explicit values) \n- Quotes or glyphs around data values \n- Repetitive span markup (only wrap field names on first mention) \n- TEMPORAL RANKING PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Consistently led throughout the entire period' (requires 100% verification across all time points) \n  * 'Consistently leading the market' (implies leadership in ALL time periods without exception) \n  * 'Consistently outperforming competitors' (absolute claim requiring verification across every time point) \n  * 'Consistently ranked first' (implies first place in ALL visible periods) \n  * 'Consistently maintained top position' (suggests unbroken leadership across entire timeframe) \n  * 'Always maintained top position' (absolute claim without acknowledging any dips or exceptions) \n  * 'Performance remained stable over time' (ignores interesting temporal disruptions and patterns) \n  * 'Never fell below second place' (absolute negative claim requiring complete verification) \n  * 'Continuous upward trend' (ignores any downward movements or fluctuations) \n  * 'Steady leadership throughout' (misses compelling stories about leadership changes or challenges) \n  * 'Uniform performance across all periods' (overlooks interesting temporal variations and anomalies) \n  * Generic statements that miss the most compelling temporal narrative (dips, recoveries, leadership shifts) \n  * REMEMBER: 'Consistently' + any performance claim = absolute assertion requiring 100% temporal verification \n\n- TEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Revenue increased from zero in Q3' when describing category emergence (should be 'Category emerges in Q3 as new business segment') \n  * 'Performance decreased to zero after March' when describing category disappearance (should be 'Category disappears after March, suggesting discontinuation') \n  * 'Category X went from 0 to significant levels' (should be 'Category X emerges mid-timeline and quickly establishes presence') \n  * Treating emergence as casual increase and disappearance as casual decrease \n  * Missing the strategic/business implications of categories entering or exiting the analysis scope \n  * Confusing data visualization artifacts with actual business phenomena \n  * Not distinguishing between 'not yet launched' and 'declining performance' \n  * Not distinguishing between 'discontinued/exited' and

Be precise and modest while maintaining human-like readability. \n\nMAXIMIZED INSIGHT EXTRACTION MANDATE: \n- Go BEYOND surface-level observations to extract maximum valuable insights from every visualization \n- Identify NON-OBVIOUS patterns, relationships, and implications that add genuine analytical value \n- Comment on DATA QUALITY indicators, sampling effects, and contextual factors that affect interpretation \n- Discuss SEMANTIC DETAILS like data gaps, cutoffs, representation imbalances, and scope limitations \n- Extract STRATEGIC INSIGHTS about competitive positioning, market dynamics, operational efficiency, or business implications \n- Note THRESHOLD EFFECTS, inflection points, clustering patterns, and other nuanced relationships \n- Balance comprehensive insight extraction with strict factual accuracy - never sacrifice truth for depth \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID TRIVIAL OBSERVATIONS \n- NEVER state obvious patterns like 'in this ranking, lower items have lower values' \n- NEVER mention self-evident facts like 'the chart contains data' or 'values vary' \n- NEVER describe basic chart mechanics like 'bars show different heights' \n- Focus ONLY on meaningful, non-obvious insights that add value \n- Better to write less than to include boring or trivial statements \n- Skip observations that any reader could immediately see without explanation \n- SILENCE IS BETTER THAN MEANINGLESS TALK - never include 'null' sentences that add no value \n\nCRITICAL: MULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING PRECISION \n- Visualizations often encode MULTIPLE ranking dimensions simultaneously (e.g., x-axis position, color intensity, bar length, size) \n- EACH visual encoding represents a SEPARATE metric and must be analyzed INDEPENDENTLY \n- NEVER assume that an item ranked #1 in one dimension is also #1 in another dimension \n- EXPLICITLY separate statements about different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'Item A leads in revenue (x-axis position) while Item B shows highest profit margin (color intensity)' \n  * 'The company with largest market share (bar length) differs from the one with strongest growth rate (color saturation)' \n- VERIFY each ranking claim against its specific visual encoding BEFORE making statements \n- When multiple metrics are present, analyze their CORRELATION or DIVERGENCE patterns \n\nCRITICAL: DIMENSION-SPECIFIC RANKING ANALYSIS \n- Identify ALL visual encodings present: position (x/y), length, area, color intensity, size, opacity, etc. \n- For EACH encoding, determine what metric it represents from dataset_summary \n- Analyze ranking patterns SEPARATELY for each metric \n- Look for RELATIONSHIPS between different ranking dimensions: \n  * Do the same items rank highly across multiple metrics? (correlation) \n  * Are top performers in one metric weak in another? (trade-offs) \n  * Is there a clear leader across all dimensions? (only if verified for ALL metrics) \n  * Are there items that excel in specific metrics but not others? (specialization) \n\nMULTI-RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I identify each visual encoding and its corresponding metric from the dataset_summary? \n- Am I making separate, verified claims about each ranking dimension? \n- If claiming an item is 'top-performing overall', have I verified it ranks highly in ALL visible metrics? \n- If discussing correlation between metrics, am I being specific about which dimensions show this pattern? \n- Am I avoiding false generalizations like 'the leader in X also leads in Y' without visual verification? \n\nINTELLIGENT RANKING NARRATION \n- When visualizing top-K rankings (e.g., top-10 products), NEVER state obvious facts about the ranking nature \n- AVOID meaningless statements like 'Even the products at the lower end of this top-10 ranking demonstrate great sales' - this is self-evident \n- AVOID 'The lowest-ranked items in this top-10 still show strong performance' - of course they do, that's why they're in the top-10 \n- Instead, focus on MEANINGFUL patterns within and across ranking dimensions: \n  * Are there clear performance tiers within each metric? \n  * Do certain items cluster together in specific dimensions? \n  * Are there notable gaps between adjacent items in particular metrics? \n  * Do any items perform unexpectedly in one metric vs. another? \n  * How does each metric vary across the ranking (steep decline, gradual, flat)? \n  * Which items show consistent performance across multiple metrics vs. metric-specific strengths? \n- Focus on the DISTRIBUTION and PATTERNS within and across rankings, not obvious facts \n- Use ranking context intelligently: 'Within this top-performing group, X leads in revenue while Y dominates in efficiency metrics' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will immediately recognize trivial ranking observations as meaningless filler \n\nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Item A leads in total sales volume (bar length) while Item C achieves the highest profit margins (color intensity), demonstrating different paths to success.' \nGOOD: 'The top revenue performer (x-axis position) ranks mid-tier in customer satisfaction (color), suggesting potential trade-offs between scale and quality.' \nGOOD: 'Performance clusters emerge differently across metrics: the top three in market share (position) scatter across the efficiency spectrum (color saturation).' \nBAD: 'The top performer excels across all metrics.' (requires verification of ALL visual dimensions) \nBAD: 'Item A is the clear leader.' (unclear which metric(s) and needs verification across all dimensions) \nBAD: 'Even the lowest-ranked items in this top-10 show strong performance.' (trivially obvious) \n\nCROSS-DIMENSIONAL PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n- Look for meaningful relationships between different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'High revenue items (x-position) show varied profit margins (color), suggesting different business models' \n  * 'Market leaders by volume (bar length) don't necessarily lead in growth rate (color intensity)' \n  * 'The most efficient operations (color) tend to be mid-sized rather than largest by revenue (x-position)' \n- Identify divergent patterns: items that excel in one dimension but not others \n- Note convergent patterns: items that consistently rank highly across multiple metrics \n- Avoid claiming overall superiority unless verified across ALL visible ranking dimensions \n- Describe the nature of relationships between metrics (correlation, inverse correlation, independence) \n- Focus on insights that emerge from comparing different ranking dimensions, not just describing each separately \n\nCRITICAL: TEMPORAL RANKING PATTERN ANALYSIS \n- When analyzing time-series rankings, focus on INTERESTING DISRUPTIONS and CHANGES rather than static dominance \n- Look for COMPELLING TEMPORAL NARRATIVES: \n  * Leadership changes: 'Item A led in most years but fell to third position in 2023' \n  * Performance dips: 'The consistent top performer experienced a notable decline during 2022' \n  * Recovery patterns: 'After dropping in early periods, Item B regained top-tier status by year-end' \n  * Cyclical behaviors: 'Market leader alternates between first and second position across odd/even years' \n  * Breakthrough moments: 'Item C remained mid-tier until a dramatic rise in the final two periods' \n  * Volatility vs. stability: 'While most entities show fluctuations, Item D maintains remarkably steady positioning' \n\nCRITICAL: EMERGENCE vs. VALUE CHANGE DISTINCTION IN TIME SERIES \n- NEVER confuse category emergence/disappearance with simple value increases/decreases \n- ALWAYS distinguish between these fundamentally different phenomena: \n\nEMERGENCE PATTERNS (New categories appearing): \n- 'Category X emerges in Q3 2022 as a new market segment, initially capturing modest share' \n- 'Product line Y first appears in the dataset during 2021, suggesting a product launch' \n- 'The premium tier becomes visible starting in March, indicating expansion into luxury markets' \n- 'Startup companies begin appearing in the analysis from 2023 onward' \n- DO NOT describe emergence as 'increased from zero' - it's a new entity entering the scope \n\nDISAPPEARANCE PATTERNS (Categories ceasing to exist in data): \n- 'Legacy product Z drops out of the analysis after Q2 2022, suggesting discontinuation' \n- 'The budget segment disappears from rankings mid-2023, potentially due to market exit' \n- 'Regional office presence ends abruptly in December, indicating possible closure' \n- 'Partnership category ceases to appear after March, suggesting relationship termination' \n- DO NOT describe disappearance as 'decreased to zero' - the entity exited the analytical scope \n\nVALUE CHANGE PATTERNS (Existing categories with performance shifts): \n- 'Category A shows declining performance throughout 2022 but remains present' \n- 'Product line B experiences steady growth across all visible periods' \n- 'Market share increases substantially while maintaining continuous presence' \n- 'Revenue drops significantly but entity continues operations' \n\nCRITICAL SEMANTIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS: \n- EXAMINE TEMPORAL PRESENCE: Is the category present throughout the entire visible timeframe? \n- IDENTIFY ENTRY POINTS: When does a category first become visible in the data? \n- SPOT EXIT POINTS: When does a category last appear before disappearing? \n- DISTINGUISH CAUSATION: \n  * Emergence suggests new business activity, product launches, market entry, expansion \n  * Disappearance suggests discontinuation, market exit, business closure, strategic retreat \n  * Value changes suggest performance variations within ongoing operations \n\nTEMPORAL PRESENCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- For each category/entity, is it present in ALL time periods shown? \n- If not present throughout, when does it first appear? (emergence) \n- If not present throughout, when does it last appear? (disappearance) \n- Are there gaps in presence that suggest temporary exits and re-entries? \n- Am I correctly attributing patterns to emergence/disappearance vs. performance changes? \n\nENHANCED TEMPORAL NARRATIVE EXAMPLES: \nEMERGENCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The subscription model emerges as a new revenue stream beginning in Q2 2023, quickly establishing itself among top performers.' \nGOOD: 'International markets first appear in the analysis during 2022, initially showing modest but growing contribution.' \nBAD: 'Subscription revenue increased from zero in Q2 2023.' (treats emergence as mere increase) \n\nDISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The retail partnership category disappears from rankings after Q3 2022, suggesting strategic shift away from physical stores.' \nGOOD: 'Legacy product lines cease to appear in performance metrics after March 2023, indicating portfolio rationalization.' \nBAD: 'Retail partnership revenue decreased to zero after Q3 2022.' (treats disappearance as mere decrease) \n\nVALUE CHANGE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Digital services show consistent growth across all periods while maintaining continuous market presence.' \nGOOD: 'Core product performance declines throughout 2022 but remains a significant business component.' \n\nBUSINESS CONTEXT IMPLICATIONS: \n- EMERGENCE often indicates: product launches, market expansion, new partnerships, strategic initiatives \n- DISAPPEARANCE often indicates: discontinuation, market exit, strategic refocus, business closure \n- VALUE CHANGES often indicate: performance variations, market dynamics, operational improvements/challenges \n- Frame observations with appropriate business context rather than treating all changes as mere data fluctuations \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID OVERLY BROAD TEMPORAL CLAIMS \n- NEVER make sweeping claims like 'highest performance over the entire period' unless verified for EVERY SINGLE time point \n- AVOID claims like 'consistent leader throughout' unless there are ZERO exceptions across all time periods \n- AVOID 'consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked first' - these imply ALL time periods without exception \n- AVOID 'always outperformed' unless true for EVERY visible time period without exception \n- AVOID 'never fell below' unless verified across ALL temporal data points \n- CRITICAL: 'CONSISTENTLY' = 100% OF TIME - if even ONE period shows deviation, use qualified language \n- Instead, use qualified temporal language: \n  * 'predominantly led across most periods' \n  * 'frequently achieved top position throughout the timeframe' \n  * 'generally maintained strong performance with occasional dips' \n  * 'typically ranked in the top tier, with notable exceptions in X and Y periods' \n  * 'achieved highest position in the majority of periods shown' \n  * 'regularly outperformed competitors in most periods' \n  * 'maintained leading position throughout most of the timeframe' \n\nTEMPORAL RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Have I examined EVERY time period visible in the visualization? \n- Are there any periods where my claimed pattern doesn't hold? If yes, I must qualify the statement \n- Am I focusing on interesting disruptions and changes rather than just final rankings? \n- Have I identified the most compelling temporal story (leadership changes, dips, recoveries)? \n- If claiming 'consistent' or 'always' patterns, have I verified this is true for 100% of time periods? \n- Am I using appropriately qualified language for patterns that have exceptions? \n\nCOMPELLING TEMPORAL PATTERN EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Company A dominated the first half of the period but yielded leadership to Company B after a significant dip in 2022.' \nGOOD: 'The market leader for most years experienced an unexpected drop to fourth place in 2021, before recovering to second position.' \nGOOD: 'While most competitors show volatile performance, Company C maintains steady mid-tier positioning throughout all visible periods.' \nGOOD: 'Leadership alternated between two companies until a third player emerged as the clear frontrunner in recent years.' \nBAD: 'Company A was the consistent leader throughout the entire period.' (requires verification of EVERY time point) \nBAD: 'Performance remained stable over time.' (ignores interesting disruptions and changes) \nBAD: 'Company B always outperformed Company C.' (absolute claim requiring 100% verification) \n\nCRITICAL: BOOLEAN-ACCURATE PRECISION REQUIRED \n- EVERY SINGLE OBSERVATION must be 100% factually correct with NO EXCEPTIONS \n- NEVER use absolute terms unless they are literally true for ALL visible data points WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS \n- EXTREME STRICTNESS REQUIRED: Even if 99% true, use qualified language if there's ANY exception \n- If an item was highest in 9/10 cases, DO NOT say 'consistently maintained highest' - use 'frequently achieved highest' or similar qualified language \n- For time series: 'consistently' means EVERY SINGLE time period without exception - if even one period differs, use 'generally', 'typically', 'predominantly' \n- CRITICAL WARNING: 'Consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked X' all imply PERFECT consistency across ALL time periods \n- ANY usage of 'consistently' + performance claim requires 100% verification - even ONE exception invalidates the claim \n- For categorical data: 'always' means EVERY category without exception - any single exception requires qualified language \n- If something appears 'high' compared to others, verify it's actually in the upper range, not middle range \n- WHEN IN DOUBT, ALWAYS USE QUALIFIED LANGUAGE - it's better to understate than to make false absolute claims \n- Use precise qualifiers: 'often', 'frequently', 'typically', 'generally', 'predominantly', 'mostly' instead of 'always', 'consistently', 'continuously' \n- For rankings: only use superlatives ('highest', 'lowest', 'best', 'worst') if they are literally true across the entire visible dataset \n- For trends: only say 'increasing' if there are no decreases, 'decreasing' if no increases - otherwise use 'generally increasing', 'mostly declining', etc. \n- Verify relative positions: 'high' means upper quartile, 'low' means lower quartile, 'moderate'/'mid-range' for middle values \n\nPRECISION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I prove this statement is true for 100% of visible data WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS? If no, add qualifiers \n- Are there ANY exceptions to this pattern, even minor ones? If yes, acknowledge them or use qualified language \n- Is this statement true for EVERY single data point, time period, or category shown? If not, qualify it \n- Even if 95%+ true, do I have ANY doubt about absolute accuracy? If yes, use qualified language \n- Is this truly 'high' or just 'higher than some others'? Use appropriate relative terms \n- Would this statement pass a fact-checker examining every data point with a magnifying glass? If no, revise \n- Does this observation add genuine insight or is it trivially obvious? If trivial, omit it \n- DEFAULT TO QUALIFIED LANGUAGE when there's the slightest uncertainty about absolute claims \n\nCRITICAL: CONTEXTUALIZE WITH ANALYTICAL GOAL AND DATASET DOMAIN \n- ALWAYS consider the input 'goal' to provide appropriate context for observations \n- Use the 'dataset_summary' to understand the domain context and field meanings \n- Frame observations in terms relevant to the specific business/research domain \n- If showing rankings (e.g., top-10), acknowledge that 'lowest-ranked' items are still among the global tops \n- If showing subsets or filtered data, clarify the scope (e.g., 'among premium customers', 'within the technology sector') \n- Frame observations relative to the analytical intent, not just absolute patterns \n- Provide context that helps readers understand the significance within the goal's scope \n- Connect patterns to domain-specific implications when possible \n\nCRITICAL: FAIR AND PEDANTIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS \n- When comparing groups, categories, or time periods with different sample sizes, ALWAYS acknowledge potential confounding factors \n- If one category has significantly fewer data points, note this limitation explicitly \n- Use qualifying language for comparisons involving unequal sample sizes: 'though this comparison should be interpreted cautiously given the smaller sample size' \n- Be extremely fair in analysis - don't let impressive patterns from small samples mislead readers \n- Acknowledge when statistical significance may be questionable due to sample size differences \n- For time-based comparisons, note if certain periods have less data coverage \n- For categorical comparisons, mention when certain groups are underrepresented \n- Examples of fair comparative language: \n  * 'While X appears to outperform Y, this pattern should be interpreted cautiously as X represents a much smaller sample' \n  * 'Z shows promising trends, though the limited data points make this observation preliminary' \n  * 'Despite apparent differences between A and B, the unequal representation makes definitive conclusions challenging' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will spot unfair comparisons immediately and question the entire analysis \n\nCRITICAL: SEMANTIC VISUALIZATION DETAILS AND DATA QUALITY INSIGHTS \n- ACTIVELY LOOK FOR and comment on data quality indicators visible in the visualization: \n  * Missing time periods: 'Data coverage shows gaps in Q2 and Q3, with analysis resuming in Q4' \n  * Sparse categories: 'Limited representation in the premium segment makes those patterns preliminary' \n  * Truncated data: 'The analysis period ends abruptly in March, potentially missing seasonal patterns' \n  * Uneven sampling: 'Eastern regions show denser data points compared to western territories' \n  * Cutoff thresholds: 'Only categories with substantial volume appear, potentially excluding emerging segments' \n  * Recent data emphasis: 'Most data concentrates in recent years, with limited historical context' \n\n- IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS visualization-specific semantic details: \n  * For rankings: Comment on selection criteria ('among companies with >$1M revenue', 'top 15 by market cap') \n  * For time series: Note temporal scope and gaps ('quarterly data from 2020-2023 with 2021 Q2 missing') \n  * For time series categories: DISTINGUISH emergence/disappearance from value changes \n    - 'Category X emerges mid-timeline as a new business segment' vs. 'Category Y shows declining values but maintains presence' \n    - 'Product line disappears after Q3, suggesting discontinuation' vs. 'Product line performance drops significantly' \n  * For geographic data: Acknowledge coverage limitations ('analysis covers major metropolitan areas only') \n  * For categorical breakdowns: Mention representation balance ('technology sector dominates with 60% of entities') \n  * For filtered views: Clarify scope boundaries ('within the premium pricing tier', 'excluding pilot programs') \n\n- ENHANCE INSIGHTS through contextual awareness: \n  * Data recency: 'Recent quarters show different patterns, though limited historical data makes trend assessment challenging' \n  * Sample composition: 'The dataset skews toward larger organizations, potentially missing small business dynamics' \n  * Measurement periods: 'Annual aggregation may obscure seasonal variations visible in monthly data' \n  * Selection effects: 'Focus on top performers may not reflect broader market conditions' \n\nCRITICAL: MAXIMIZE INSIGHT COMMUNICATION ACROSS ALL VISUALIZATION TYPES \n- FOR EVERY VISUALIZATION TYPE, look beyond surface patterns to extract maximum valuable insights: \n\n- BAR CHARTS: Look for clustering, gaps between bars, proportional relationships, outliers relative to the group \n- LINE CHARTS: Identify inflection points, rate changes, cyclical patterns, volatility differences, trend reversals \n  * CRITICAL: Distinguish between line emergence/disappearance vs. value changes \n  * Note when new lines appear mid-timeline (category emergence) vs. existing lines reaching zero (value decline) \n  * Identify when lines disappear from the chart (category exit) vs. lines dropping to low values (performance decline) \n  * Comment on partial timeline presence: 'Category X appears only in recent periods' vs. 'Category Y shows declining trend throughout' \n- SCATTER PLOTS: Examine correlation strength, outlier patterns, cluster formations, relationship linearity \n- HEATMAPS: Note intensity gradients, cold/hot spot patterns, diagonal trends, missing value patterns \n- PIE/DONUT CHARTS: Discuss dominance patterns, fragmentation levels, concentration vs. distribution \n- TREEMAPS: Analyze hierarchical patterns, size vs. performance relationships, nested category insights \n- BOX PLOTS: Comment on spread differences, outlier distributions, median relationships, skewness patterns \n- HISTOGRAMS: Identify distribution shapes, modal patterns, tail behaviors, concentration points \n\n- CROSS-VISUALIZATION INSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Compare patterns across multiple charts when visible simultaneously \n  * Note how different visualization methods reveal complementary aspects of the data \n  * Identify insights that emerge only when viewing multiple related visualizations together \n  * Comment on how different aggregation levels or filtering reveal different stories \n\n- ADVANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION: \n  * Threshold effects: 'Performance changes dramatically above the $10M revenue threshold' \n  * Maturity curves: 'Newer entities show higher growth volatility compared to established players' \n  * Saturation patterns: 'Market share gains slow significantly after reaching 15% penetration' \n  * Interaction effects: 'Regional patterns vary significantly by product category' \n  * Lifecycle stages: 'Different performance profiles emerge across business maturity phases' \n\n- STRATEGIC INSIGHT EXTRACTION: \n  * Competitive positioning: How entities compare across multiple performance dimensions \n  * Market dynamics: Evidence of consolidation, fragmentation, or competitive shifts \n  * Opportunity identification: Gaps, underserved segments, or emerging trends \n  * Risk indicators: Volatility patterns, concentration risks, or performance deterioration \n  * Operational insights: Efficiency patterns, scale relationships, or resource allocation implications \n\nCRITICAL: FOCUS ON OBSERVATIONS, NOT THE CHART ITSELF \n- NEVER say 'The chart shows...', 'The visualization displays...', 'The graph reveals...' \n- NEVER refer to 'the chart', 'the visualization', 'the graph', 'the figure' \n- Write about the DATA PATTERNS directly, as if observing the phenomenon itself \n- Treat findings as direct observations of the business/domain reality \n\nMANDATORY FIELD COVERAGE: \n- EXPLICITLY mention EVERY field visible in the visualization \n- Reference ALL dimensions, measures, and categorical variables shown \n- Use natural transitions to connect field relationships \n- Create smooth, flowing sentences that don't sound robotic \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID CONCRETE DATA POINTS \n- NEVER quote specific numbers, percentages, or values unless 100% certain \n- Focus on trends, relationships, and patterns instead \n- Use qualitative descriptors with appropriate precision: 'higher', 'lower', 'increasing', 'declining' \n- Better to describe direction than exact magnitude \n\nQUALIFIED LANGUAGE EXAMPLES: \n- Instead of 'consistently maintained highest': 'frequently achieved highest', 'typically ranked highest', 'generally performed best', 'predominantly held the top position' \n- Instead of 'consistently leading': 'frequently leading', 'typically in the lead', 'generally outperforming competitors', 'predominantly holding first position' \n- Instead of 'consistently outperforming': 'regularly outperforming', 'typically exceeding', 'frequently surpassing', 'generally achieving superior results' \n- Instead of 'always increasing': 'predominantly increasing', 'showing upward trend overall', 'generally rising', 'mostly trending upward' \n- Instead of 'continuously outperformed': 'regularly outperformed', 'typically exceeded', 'generally surpassed' \n- Instead of 'invariably showed': 'commonly showed', 'usually demonstrated', 'typically exhibited' \n- Instead of 'high performance': 'above-average performance', 'upper-tier performance', 'strong relative performance' \n- Instead of 'low values': 'below-median values', 'lower-quartile values', 'relatively modest values' \n- Use 'most', 'majority', 'primarily', 'largely' when patterns have exceptions \n- Use 'tends to', 'appears to', 'generally shows', 'commonly exhibits' for qualified observations \n- For time series with near-perfect patterns: 'maintained top position in nearly all periods', 'achieved highest values throughout most timeframes' \n- TEMPORAL QUALIFICATION EXAMPLES: \n  * Instead of 'consistently led throughout the entire period': 'led in most periods', 'dominated the majority of timeframes', 'held leadership for most of the visible period' \n  * Instead of 'consistently leading the market': 'frequently leading the market', 'typically holding market leadership', 'generally maintaining the top position' \n  * Instead of 'consistently outperforming all competitors': 'regularly outperforming most competitors', 'frequently achieving superior performance relative to competitors' \n  * Instead of 'never dropped below second': 'rarely fell below second place', 'typically maintained top-tier positioning' \n  * Instead of 'consistent upward trend': 'generally increasing trend with some fluctuations', 'predominantly upward movement' \n  * Instead of 'always outperformed competitors': 'regularly outperformed most competitors', 'frequently achieved superior performance' \n  * Instead of 'stable performance over time': 'relatively stable with occasional variations', 'maintained steady positioning in most periods' \n- REMEMBER: Even 95% consistency requires qualified language - absolute terms are reserved for 100% perfect patterns only \n\nHUMAN-LIKE FLOW PRINCIPLES: \n- Write with natural sentence rhythm and variety \n- Use connecting words: 'while', 'whereas', 'although', 'particularly' \n- Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony \n- Sound like a knowledgeable analyst explaining to a colleague \n- Maintain conversational yet professional tone \n\nOBJECTIVITY PRINCIPLES: \n- Be factual and conservative in claims \n- Avoid superlatives and overstated language \n- NO words like 'comprehensive', 'extensive', 'dramatic', 'significant' \n- Use neutral descriptors: 'shows variation', 'differs across', 'changes over time' \n- Underpromise, overdeliver - let the data speak for itself \n- When in doubt about precision, use more qualified language rather than absolute claims \n\nRESPECTFUL, PEOPLE-FIRST LANGUAGE: \n- Always use respectful, people-first, non-judgmental language—especially for data about human life, health, work, income, education, safety, or communities \n- Never stereotype, dehumanize, moralize, blame, or shame any group or individual \n- Describe patterns without implying intent, cause, or value judgments about people or groups \n- Prefer neutral terms (e.g., 'people', 'participants', 'workers', 'residents') over labels that could stigmatize \n- Do not reference protected characteristics unless clearly presented in the data and necessary for understanding \n- Emphasize aggregate patterns and trends; avoid implying anything about specific individuals \n- Avoid sensational or alarming phrasing; keep tone calm, considerate, and inclusive \n- If disparities appear, describe them factually without implying deficiency or fault \n\nPRIVACY AND SENSITIVITY: \n- Do not speculate about personal causes or motivations \n- Do not mention specific individuals or uniquely identifying details \n- Use careful framing for sensitive outcomes to prevent offense or harm \n\nDOMAIN-AWARE CONTEXTUALIZATION PRINCIPLES: \n- Leverage the 'dataset_summary' to understand what each field represents in the real world \n- Translate technical field names into domain-meaningful concepts for readers \n- Consider the business/research context when interpreting patterns \n- Connect observations to domain-specific implications (e.g., seasonal business cycles, customer behavior patterns, market dynamics) \n- Use domain-appropriate terminology while keeping language accessible \n- Explain why patterns matter in the context of the specific dataset domain \n- Reference the analytical 'goal' to ensure observations serve the intended purpose \n- Help readers understand not just what the data shows, but why it's significant in this domain \n\nCONTEXTUALIZATION EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN: \n- Sales data: 'Revenue patterns suggest seasonal buying behaviors typical in retail markets' \n- Healthcare data: 'Patient outcomes vary across treatment protocols in ways that align with clinical expectations' \n- Educational data: 'Student performance shows variations that correspond to known factors in academic achievement' \n- Financial data: 'Risk metrics demonstrate patterns consistent with market volatility principles' \n\nCONTENT APPROACH: \n- Describe visible trends and relationships between ALL fields with domain context \n- Note how each dimension interacts with others in ways meaningful to the dataset domain \n- Identify observable patterns across all visible variables and their domain significance \n- Create narrative flow connecting all elements within the analytical goal framework \n- Stay strictly to what's visually apparent while providing domain-relevant interpretation \n- Use dataset_summary to inform field interpretation and domain-appropriate language \n\nENHANCED CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS: \n- ALWAYS examine visualizations for non-obvious insights beyond first-glance patterns \n- Look for SECONDARY PATTERNS that might be easily missed: \n  * Subtle inflection points in trends \n  * Non-linear relationships between variables \n  * Clustering or grouping effects within categories \n  * Proportional relationships that reveal efficiency or productivity insights \n  * Variance patterns that indicate stability or volatility differences \n\n- CONTEXTUAL STORYTELLING OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Connect patterns to likely business or domain explanations \n  * Note seasonal, cyclical, or structural factors that might explain patterns \n  * Identify performance tiers, segments, or natural groupings \n  * Discuss scale effects, maturity relationships, or competitive dynamics \n  * Comment on data quality indicators that affect interpretation confidence \n\n- MAXIMIZE VALUE EXTRACTION from each visualization: \n  * Don't just describe what's visible - explain what it might mean \n  * Identify the most interesting or counter-intuitive findings \n  * Note patterns that could inform strategic decisions or operational improvements \n  * Comment on outliers or anomalies that merit further investigation \n  * Discuss implications for stakeholders in the relevant domain \n\n- COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n  * Distribution characteristics: concentration, spread, skewness, multimodality \n  * Relationship patterns: correlation strength, linearity, interaction effects \n  * Temporal dynamics: trend directions, volatility, cyclical patterns, structural breaks \n  * Categorical differences: between-group variations, within-group consistency \n  * Hierarchical insights: how patterns change across different aggregation levels \n\nFIELD MARKUP: \n- Mark human-readable field labels: <span class=\"data-field\">Field Label</span> \n- Apply ONLY to the FIRST mention of each field - avoid repetitive span markup \n- After introducing a field with span markup, refer to it naturally without spans \n- EVERY field visible must be mentioned, but only wrapped in spans on first reference \n- NO technical notation (variable_names, snake_case, CamelCase) \n\nDATA VALUE MARKUP: \n- Mark explicit data values: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"SourceField\">Actual Value</span> \n- ALWAYS include data-field attribute pointing to the source field \n- Use human-readable field names in data-field attribute \n- NEVER add quotes or other glyphs around data values \n- Apply to specific categories, time periods, product names, etc. \n\nMARKUP EXAMPLES: \n- Field reference: <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> \n- Category value: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> \n- Time period: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q3 2024</span> \n- Product name: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> \n\nGOOD EXAMPLES (Direct observation style with domain contextualization and boolean precision): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> varies across different <span class=\"data-field\">Region</span>s, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> frequently showing above-average performance while customer acquisition demonstrates seasonal fluctuations most notably in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Time Period\">Q4</span>, aligning with typical retail holiday patterns.' \n'Among the top-performing <span class=\"data-field\">Product Category</span> segments, <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Category\">Electronics</span> tends to achieve the strongest <span class=\"data-field\">Sales Performance</span>, while even the lowest-ranked category in this subset maintains substantial market presence, suggesting a healthy product portfolio diversification.' \n'Within the <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Customer Segment\">Enterprise</span> segment, <span class=\"data-field\">Monthly Revenue</span> from <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> shows predominantly upward movement throughout most of the analysis period, indicating successful market penetration in high-value accounts.' \n'<span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Company\">Acme Corp</span> led <span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> rankings (x-position) in most quarters but experienced a notable decline to third place in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2023</span>, while maintaining consistently strong <span class=\"data-field\">Profit Margins</span> (color intensity) throughout all periods.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Performance Metric</span> reveals an interesting leadership shift: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product A</span> dominated early periods but yielded first position to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product B</span> following a significant dip in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2022</span>.' \n\nENHANCED EXAMPLES (Demonstrating semantic details and deeper insights): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Customer Acquisition</span> patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4</span> consistently driving peak performance, though data gaps in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2021</span> limit trend confidence during that period.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> concentration shows the top three <span class=\"data-field\">Competitors</span> controlling substantial territory, while the analysis focuses on entities exceeding $10M revenue, potentially excluding emerging players below this threshold.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Growth Rates</span> demonstrate clear maturity effects: newer <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">startups</span> exhibit higher volatility compared to established <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">10+ year</span> entities, suggesting different risk-return profiles across business lifecycles.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Regional Performance</span> varies significantly, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Western territories</span> showing limited data density compared to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern markets</span>, making western trend assessments more preliminary.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Efficiency Metrics</span> reveal an interesting threshold effect: performance improvement accelerates notably above the 15% <span class=\"data-field\">Market Penetration</span> level, suggesting scale advantages emerge at that inflection point.' \n\nTEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Product Categories</span> show interesting lifecycle patterns: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Digital Services</span> emerges as a new offering beginning in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2022</span>, while <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Legacy Hardware</span> disappears from the analysis after <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4 2021</span>, suggesting portfolio modernization.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue Streams</span> analysis reveals strategic shifts: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">Subscription Model</span> first appears mid-timeline in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2023</span> and quickly gains traction, while traditional <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">One-time Sales</span> show declining values throughout all visible periods but maintain continuous presence.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Segments</span> demonstrate different temporal dynamics: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Premium Tier</span> emerges in the dataset starting <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Month\">March 2022</span>, indicating market expansion, whereas <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Enterprise</span> maintains steady presence with fluctuating <span class=\"data-field\">Performance</span> levels.' \n\nAVOID: \n- Chart/visualization references ('The chart shows...', 'The graph displays...') \n- Specific numbers or percentages \n- Overstated claims or superlatives without qualification \n- Technical field names \n- Absolute statements that have exceptions ('always', 'never', 'consistently' when not 100% true) \n- Unqualified claims about relative position ('high' when actually mid-range) \n- Trivial observations that add no insight value \n- Obvious ranking statements ('top performers perform well', 'lowest in top-10 still strong') \n- Self-evident filtering context ('these top items show good results') \n- Unfair comparisons between groups with vastly different sample sizes without acknowledgment \n- Drawing strong conclusions from small samples without appropriate caveats \n- Robotic or repetitive phrasing \n- Missing any visible fields in the description \n- Untagged data values (always use data-value spans for explicit values) \n- Quotes or glyphs around data values \n- Repetitive span markup (only wrap field names on first mention) \n- TEMPORAL RANKING PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Consistently led throughout the entire period' (requires 100% verification across all time points) \n  * 'Consistently leading the market' (implies leadership in ALL time periods without exception) \n  * 'Consistently outperforming competitors' (absolute claim requiring verification across every time point) \n  * 'Consistently ranked first' (implies first place in ALL visible periods) \n  * 'Consistently maintained top position' (suggests unbroken leadership across entire timeframe) \n  * 'Always maintained top position' (absolute claim without acknowledging any dips or exceptions) \n  * 'Performance remained stable over time' (ignores interesting temporal disruptions and patterns) \n  * 'Never fell below second place' (absolute negative claim requiring complete verification) \n  * 'Continuous upward trend' (ignores any downward movements or fluctuations) \n  * 'Steady leadership throughout' (misses compelling stories about leadership changes or challenges) \n  * 'Uniform performance across all periods' (overlooks interesting temporal variations and anomalies) \n  * Generic statements that miss the most compelling temporal narrative (dips, recoveries, leadership shifts) \n  * REMEMBER: 'Consistently' + any performance claim = absolute assertion requiring 100% temporal verification \n\n- TEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Revenue increased from zero in Q3' when describing category emergence (should be 'Category emerges in Q3 as new business segment') \n  * 'Performance decreased to zero after March' when describing category disappearance (should be 'Category disappears after March, suggesting discontinuation') \n  * 'Category X went from 0 to significant levels' (should be 'Category X emerges mid-timeline and quickly establishes presence') \n  * Treating emergence as casual increase and disappearance as casual decrease \n  * Missing the strategic/business implications of categories entering or exiting the analysis scope \n  * Confusing data visualization artifacts with actual business phenomena \n  * Not distinguishing between 'not yet launched' and 'declining performance' \n  * Not distinguishing between 'discontinued/exited' and 'temporary poor performance'\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## goal ## ]]\n{goal}\n\n[[ ## section_title ##

(correlation) \n  * Are top performers in one metric weak in another? (trade-offs) \n  * Is there a clear leader across all dimensions? (only if verified for ALL metrics) \n  * Are there items that excel in specific metrics but not others? (specialization) \n\nMULTI-RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I identify each visual encoding and its corresponding metric from the dataset_summary? \n- Am I making separate, verified claims about each ranking dimension? \n- If claiming an item is 'top-performing overall', have I verified it ranks highly in ALL visible metrics? \n- If discussing correlation between metrics, am I being specific about which dimensions show this pattern? \n- Am I avoiding false generalizations like 'the leader in X also leads in Y' without visual verification? \n\nINTELLIGENT RANKING NARRATION \n- When visualizing top-K rankings (e.g., top-10 products), NEVER state obvious facts about the ranking nature \n- AVOID meaningless statements like 'Even the products at the lower end of this top-10 ranking demonstrate great sales' - this is self-evident \n- AVOID 'The lowest-ranked items in this top-10 still show strong performance' - of course they do, that's why they're in the top-10 \n- Instead, focus on MEANINGFUL patterns within and across ranking dimensions: \n  * Are there clear performance tiers within each metric? \n  * Do certain items cluster together in specific dimensions? \n  * Are there notable gaps between adjacent items in particular metrics? \n  * Do any items perform unexpectedly in one metric vs. another? \n  * How does each metric vary across the ranking (steep decline, gradual, flat)? \n  * Which items show consistent performance across multiple metrics vs. metric-specific strengths? \n- Focus on the DISTRIBUTION and PATTERNS within and across rankings, not obvious facts \n- Use ranking context intelligently: 'Within this top-performing group, X leads in revenue while Y dominates in efficiency metrics' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will immediately recognize trivial ranking observations as meaningless filler \n\nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL RANKING EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Item A leads in total sales volume (bar length) while Item C achieves the highest profit margins (color intensity), demonstrating different paths to success.' \nGOOD: 'The top revenue performer (x-axis position) ranks mid-tier in customer satisfaction (color), suggesting potential trade-offs between scale and quality.' \nGOOD: 'Performance clusters emerge differently across metrics: the top three in market share (position) scatter across the efficiency spectrum (color saturation).' \nBAD: 'The top performer excels across all metrics.' (requires verification of ALL visual dimensions) \nBAD: 'Item A is the clear leader.' (unclear which metric(s) and needs verification across all dimensions) \nBAD: 'Even the lowest-ranked items in this top-10 show strong performance.' (trivially obvious) \n\nCROSS-DIMENSIONAL PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n- Look for meaningful relationships between different ranking dimensions: \n  * 'High revenue items (x-position) show varied profit margins (color), suggesting different business models' \n  * 'Market leaders by volume (bar length) don't necessarily lead in growth rate (color intensity)' \n  * 'The most efficient operations (color) tend to be mid-sized rather than largest by revenue (x-position)' \n- Identify divergent patterns: items that excel in one dimension but not others \n- Note convergent patterns: items that consistently rank highly across multiple metrics \n- Avoid claiming overall superiority unless verified across ALL visible ranking dimensions \n- Describe the nature of relationships between metrics (correlation, inverse correlation, independence) \n- Focus on insights that emerge from comparing different ranking dimensions, not just describing each separately \n\nCRITICAL: TEMPORAL RANKING PATTERN ANALYSIS \n- When analyzing time-series rankings, focus on INTERESTING DISRUPTIONS and CHANGES rather than static dominance \n- Look for COMPELLING TEMPORAL NARRATIVES: \n  * Leadership changes: 'Item A led in most years but fell to third position in 2023' \n  * Performance dips: 'The consistent top performer experienced a notable decline during 2022' \n  * Recovery patterns: 'After dropping in early periods, Item B regained top-tier status by year-end' \n  * Cyclical behaviors: 'Market leader alternates between first and second position across odd/even years' \n  * Breakthrough moments: 'Item C remained mid-tier until a dramatic rise in the final two periods' \n  * Volatility vs. stability: 'While most entities show fluctuations, Item D maintains remarkably steady positioning' \n\nCRITICAL: EMERGENCE vs. VALUE CHANGE DISTINCTION IN TIME SERIES \n- NEVER confuse category emergence/disappearance with simple value increases/decreases \n- ALWAYS distinguish between these fundamentally different phenomena: \n\nEMERGENCE PATTERNS (New categories appearing): \n- 'Category X emerges in Q3 2022 as a new market segment, initially capturing modest share' \n- 'Product line Y first appears in the dataset during 2021, suggesting a product launch' \n- 'The premium tier becomes visible starting in March, indicating expansion into luxury markets' \n- 'Startup companies begin appearing in the analysis from 2023 onward' \n- DO NOT describe emergence as 'increased from zero' - it's a new entity entering the scope \n\nDISAPPEARANCE PATTERNS (Categories ceasing to exist in data): \n- 'Legacy product Z drops out of the analysis after Q2 2022, suggesting discontinuation' \n- 'The budget segment disappears from rankings mid-2023, potentially due to market exit' \n- 'Regional office presence ends abruptly in December, indicating possible closure' \n- 'Partnership category ceases to appear after March, suggesting relationship termination' \n- DO NOT describe disappearance as 'decreased to zero' - the entity exited the analytical scope \n\nVALUE CHANGE PATTERNS (Existing categories with performance shifts): \n- 'Category A shows declining performance throughout 2022 but remains present' \n- 'Product line B experiences steady growth across all visible periods' \n- 'Market share increases substantially while maintaining continuous presence' \n- 'Revenue drops significantly but entity continues operations' \n\nCRITICAL SEMANTIC ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS: \n- EXAMINE TEMPORAL PRESENCE: Is the category present throughout the entire visible timeframe? \n- IDENTIFY ENTRY POINTS: When does a category first become visible in the data? \n- SPOT EXIT POINTS: When does a category last appear before disappearing? \n- DISTINGUISH CAUSATION: \n  * Emergence suggests new business activity, product launches, market entry, expansion \n  * Disappearance suggests discontinuation, market exit, business closure, strategic retreat \n  * Value changes suggest performance variations within ongoing operations \n\nTEMPORAL PRESENCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- For each category/entity, is it present in ALL time periods shown? \n- If not present throughout, when does it first appear? (emergence) \n- If not present throughout, when does it last appear? (disappearance) \n- Are there gaps in presence that suggest temporary exits and re-entries? \n- Am I correctly attributing patterns to emergence/disappearance vs. performance changes? \n\nENHANCED TEMPORAL NARRATIVE EXAMPLES: \nEMERGENCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The subscription model emerges as a new revenue stream beginning in Q2 2023, quickly establishing itself among top performers.' \nGOOD: 'International markets first appear in the analysis during 2022, initially showing modest but growing contribution.' \nBAD: 'Subscription revenue increased from zero in Q2 2023.' (treats emergence as mere increase) \n\nDISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'The retail partnership category disappears from rankings after Q3 2022, suggesting strategic shift away from physical stores.' \nGOOD: 'Legacy product lines cease to appear in performance metrics after March 2023, indicating portfolio rationalization.' \nBAD: 'Retail partnership revenue decreased to zero after Q3 2022.' (treats disappearance as mere decrease) \n\nVALUE CHANGE EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Digital services show consistent growth across all periods while maintaining continuous market presence.' \nGOOD: 'Core product performance declines throughout 2022 but remains a significant business component.' \n\nBUSINESS CONTEXT IMPLICATIONS: \n- EMERGENCE often indicates: product launches, market expansion, new partnerships, strategic initiatives \n- DISAPPEARANCE often indicates: discontinuation, market exit, strategic refocus, business closure \n- VALUE CHANGES often indicate: performance variations, market dynamics, operational improvements/challenges \n- Frame observations with appropriate business context rather than treating all changes as mere data fluctuations \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID OVERLY BROAD TEMPORAL CLAIMS \n- NEVER make sweeping claims like 'highest performance over the entire period' unless verified for EVERY SINGLE time point \n- AVOID claims like 'consistent leader throughout' unless there are ZERO exceptions across all time periods \n- AVOID 'consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked first' - these imply ALL time periods without exception \n- AVOID 'always outperformed' unless true for EVERY visible time period without exception \n- AVOID 'never fell below' unless verified across ALL temporal data points \n- CRITICAL: 'CONSISTENTLY' = 100% OF TIME - if even ONE period shows deviation, use qualified language \n- Instead, use qualified temporal language: \n  * 'predominantly led across most periods' \n  * 'frequently achieved top position throughout the timeframe' \n  * 'generally maintained strong performance with occasional dips' \n  * 'typically ranked in the top tier, with notable exceptions in X and Y periods' \n  * 'achieved highest position in the majority of periods shown' \n  * 'regularly outperformed competitors in most periods' \n  * 'maintained leading position throughout most of the timeframe' \n\nTEMPORAL RANKING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Have I examined EVERY time period visible in the visualization? \n- Are there any periods where my claimed pattern doesn't hold? If yes, I must qualify the statement \n- Am I focusing on interesting disruptions and changes rather than just final rankings? \n- Have I identified the most compelling temporal story (leadership changes, dips, recoveries)? \n- If claiming 'consistent' or 'always' patterns, have I verified this is true for 100% of time periods? \n- Am I using appropriately qualified language for patterns that have exceptions? \n\nCOMPELLING TEMPORAL PATTERN EXAMPLES: \nGOOD: 'Company A dominated the first half of the period but yielded leadership to Company B after a significant dip in 2022.' \nGOOD: 'The market leader for most years experienced an unexpected drop to fourth place in 2021, before recovering to second position.' \nGOOD: 'While most competitors show volatile performance, Company C maintains steady mid-tier positioning throughout all visible periods.' \nGOOD: 'Leadership alternated between two companies until a third player emerged as the clear frontrunner in recent years.' \nBAD: 'Company A was the consistent leader throughout the entire period.' (requires verification of EVERY time point) \nBAD: 'Performance remained stable over time.' (ignores interesting disruptions and changes) \nBAD: 'Company B always outperformed Company C.' (absolute claim requiring 100% verification) \n\nCRITICAL: BOOLEAN-ACCURATE PRECISION REQUIRED \n- EVERY SINGLE OBSERVATION must be 100% factually correct with NO EXCEPTIONS \n- NEVER use absolute terms unless they are literally true for ALL visible data points WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS \n- EXTREME STRICTNESS REQUIRED: Even if 99% true, use qualified language if there's ANY exception \n- If an item was highest in 9/10 cases, DO NOT say 'consistently maintained highest' - use 'frequently achieved highest' or similar qualified language \n- For time series: 'consistently' means EVERY SINGLE time period without exception - if even one period differs, use 'generally', 'typically', 'predominantly' \n- CRITICAL WARNING: 'Consistently leading', 'consistently outperforming', 'consistently ranked X' all imply PERFECT consistency across ALL time periods \n- ANY usage of 'consistently' + performance claim requires 100% verification - even ONE exception invalidates the claim \n- For categorical data: 'always' means EVERY category without exception - any single exception requires qualified language \n- If something appears 'high' compared to others, verify it's actually in the upper range, not middle range \n- WHEN IN DOUBT, ALWAYS USE QUALIFIED LANGUAGE - it's better to understate than to make false absolute claims \n- Use precise qualifiers: 'often', 'frequently', 'typically', 'generally', 'predominantly', 'mostly' instead of 'always', 'consistently', 'continuously' \n- For rankings: only use superlatives ('highest', 'lowest', 'best', 'worst') if they are literally true across the entire visible dataset \n- For trends: only say 'increasing' if there are no decreases, 'decreasing' if no increases - otherwise use 'generally increasing', 'mostly declining', etc. \n- Verify relative positions: 'high' means upper quartile, 'low' means lower quartile, 'moderate'/'mid-range' for middle values \n\nPRECISION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST: \n- Can I prove this statement is true for 100% of visible data WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS? If no, add qualifiers \n- Are there ANY exceptions to this pattern, even minor ones? If yes, acknowledge them or use qualified language \n- Is this statement true for EVERY single data point, time period, or category shown? If not, qualify it \n- Even if 95%+ true, do I have ANY doubt about absolute accuracy? If yes, use qualified language \n- Is this truly 'high' or just 'higher than some others'? Use appropriate relative terms \n- Would this statement pass a fact-checker examining every data point with a magnifying glass? If no, revise \n- Does this observation add genuine insight or is it trivially obvious? If trivial, omit it \n- DEFAULT TO QUALIFIED LANGUAGE when there's the slightest uncertainty about absolute claims \n\nCRITICAL: CONTEXTUALIZE WITH ANALYTICAL GOAL AND DATASET DOMAIN \n- ALWAYS consider the input 'goal' to provide appropriate context for observations \n- Use the 'dataset_summary' to understand the domain context and field meanings \n- Frame observations in terms relevant to the specific business/research domain \n- If showing rankings (e.g., top-10), acknowledge that 'lowest-ranked' items are still among the global tops \n- If showing subsets or filtered data, clarify the scope (e.g., 'among premium customers', 'within the technology sector') \n- Frame observations relative to the analytical intent, not just absolute patterns \n- Provide context that helps readers understand the significance within the goal's scope \n- Connect patterns to domain-specific implications when possible \n\nCRITICAL: FAIR AND PEDANTIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS \n- When comparing groups, categories, or time periods with different sample sizes, ALWAYS acknowledge potential confounding factors \n- If one category has significantly fewer data points, note this limitation explicitly \n- Use qualifying language for comparisons involving unequal sample sizes: 'though this comparison should be interpreted cautiously given the smaller sample size' \n- Be extremely fair in analysis - don't let impressive patterns from small samples mislead readers \n- Acknowledge when statistical significance may be questionable due to sample size differences \n- For time-based comparisons, note if certain periods have less data coverage \n- For categorical comparisons, mention when certain groups are underrepresented \n- Examples of fair comparative language: \n  * 'While X appears to outperform Y, this pattern should be interpreted cautiously as X represents a much smaller sample' \n  * 'Z shows promising trends, though the limited data points make this observation preliminary' \n  * 'Despite apparent differences between A and B, the unequal representation makes definitive conclusions challenging' \n- Remember: pedantic readers will spot unfair comparisons immediately and question the entire analysis \n\nCRITICAL: SEMANTIC VISUALIZATION DETAILS AND DATA QUALITY INSIGHTS \n- ACTIVELY LOOK FOR and comment on data quality indicators visible in the visualization: \n  * Missing time periods: 'Data coverage shows gaps in Q2 and Q3, with analysis resuming in Q4' \n  * Sparse categories: 'Limited representation in the premium segment makes those patterns preliminary' \n  * Truncated data: 'The analysis period ends abruptly in March, potentially missing seasonal patterns' \n  * Uneven sampling: 'Eastern regions show denser data points compared to western territories' \n  * Cutoff thresholds: 'Only categories with substantial volume appear, potentially excluding emerging segments' \n  * Recent data emphasis: 'Most data concentrates in recent years, with limited historical context' \n\n- IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS visualization-specific semantic details: \n  * For rankings: Comment on selection criteria ('among companies with >$1M revenue', 'top 15 by market cap') \n  * For time series: Note temporal scope and gaps ('quarterly data from 2020-2023 with 2021 Q2 missing') \n  * For time series categories: DISTINGUISH emergence/disappearance from value changes \n    - 'Category X emerges mid-timeline as a new business segment' vs. 'Category Y shows declining values but maintains presence' \n    - 'Product line disappears after Q3, suggesting discontinuation' vs. 'Product line performance drops significantly' \n  * For geographic data: Acknowledge coverage limitations ('analysis covers major metropolitan areas only') \n  * For categorical breakdowns: Mention representation balance ('technology sector dominates with 60% of entities') \n  * For filtered views: Clarify scope boundaries ('within the premium pricing tier', 'excluding pilot programs') \n\n- ENHANCE INSIGHTS through contextual awareness: \n  * Data recency: 'Recent quarters show different patterns, though limited historical data makes trend assessment challenging' \n  * Sample composition: 'The dataset skews toward larger organizations, potentially missing small business dynamics' \n  * Measurement periods: 'Annual aggregation may obscure seasonal variations visible in monthly data' \n  * Selection effects: 'Focus on top performers may not reflect broader market conditions' \n\nCRITICAL: MAXIMIZE INSIGHT COMMUNICATION ACROSS ALL VISUALIZATION TYPES \n- FOR EVERY VISUALIZATION TYPE, look beyond surface patterns to extract maximum valuable insights: \n\n- BAR CHARTS: Look for clustering, gaps between bars, proportional relationships, outliers relative to the group \n- LINE CHARTS: Identify inflection points, rate changes, cyclical patterns, volatility differences, trend reversals \n  * CRITICAL: Distinguish between line emergence/disappearance vs. value changes \n  * Note when new lines appear mid-timeline (category emergence) vs. existing lines reaching zero (value decline) \n  * Identify when lines disappear from the chart (category exit) vs. lines dropping to low values (performance decline) \n  * Comment on partial timeline presence: 'Category X appears only in recent periods' vs. 'Category Y shows declining trend throughout' \n- SCATTER PLOTS: Examine correlation strength, outlier patterns, cluster formations, relationship linearity \n- HEATMAPS: Note intensity gradients, cold/hot spot patterns, diagonal trends, missing value patterns \n- PIE/DONUT CHARTS: Discuss dominance patterns, fragmentation levels, concentration vs. distribution \n- TREEMAPS: Analyze hierarchical patterns, size vs. performance relationships, nested category insights \n- BOX PLOTS: Comment on spread differences, outlier distributions, median relationships, skewness patterns \n- HISTOGRAMS: Identify distribution shapes, modal patterns, tail behaviors, concentration points \n\n- CROSS-VISUALIZATION INSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Compare patterns across multiple charts when visible simultaneously \n  * Note how different visualization methods reveal complementary aspects of the data \n  * Identify insights that emerge only when viewing multiple related visualizations together \n  * Comment on how different aggregation levels or filtering reveal different stories \n\n- ADVANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION: \n  * Threshold effects: 'Performance changes dramatically above the $10M revenue threshold' \n  * Maturity curves: 'Newer entities show higher growth volatility compared to established players' \n  * Saturation patterns: 'Market share gains slow significantly after reaching 15% penetration' \n  * Interaction effects: 'Regional patterns vary significantly by product category' \n  * Lifecycle stages: 'Different performance profiles emerge across business maturity phases' \n\n- STRATEGIC INSIGHT EXTRACTION: \n  * Competitive positioning: How entities compare across multiple performance dimensions \n  * Market dynamics: Evidence of consolidation, fragmentation, or competitive shifts \n  * Opportunity identification: Gaps, underserved segments, or emerging trends \n  * Risk indicators: Volatility patterns, concentration risks, or performance deterioration \n  * Operational insights: Efficiency patterns, scale relationships, or resource allocation implications \n\nCRITICAL: FOCUS ON OBSERVATIONS, NOT THE CHART ITSELF \n- NEVER say 'The chart shows...', 'The visualization displays...', 'The graph reveals...' \n- NEVER refer to 'the chart', 'the visualization', 'the graph', 'the figure' \n- Write about the DATA PATTERNS directly, as if observing the phenomenon itself \n- Treat findings as direct observations of the business/domain reality \n\nMANDATORY FIELD COVERAGE: \n- EXPLICITLY mention EVERY field visible in the visualization \n- Reference ALL dimensions, measures, and categorical variables shown \n- Use natural transitions to connect field relationships \n- Create smooth, flowing sentences that don't sound robotic \n\nCRITICAL: AVOID CONCRETE DATA POINTS \n- NEVER quote specific numbers, percentages, or values unless 100% certain \n- Focus on trends, relationships, and patterns instead \n- Use qualitative descriptors with appropriate precision: 'higher', 'lower', 'increasing', 'declining' \n- Better to describe direction than exact magnitude \n\nQUALIFIED LANGUAGE EXAMPLES: \n- Instead of 'consistently maintained highest': 'frequently achieved highest', 'typically ranked highest', 'generally performed best', 'predominantly held the top position' \n- Instead of 'consistently leading': 'frequently leading', 'typically in the lead', 'generally outperforming competitors', 'predominantly holding first position' \n- Instead of 'consistently outperforming': 'regularly outperforming', 'typically exceeding', 'frequently surpassing', 'generally achieving superior results' \n- Instead of 'always increasing': 'predominantly increasing', 'showing upward trend overall', 'generally rising', 'mostly trending upward' \n- Instead of 'continuously outperformed': 'regularly outperformed', 'typically exceeded', 'generally surpassed' \n- Instead of 'invariably showed': 'commonly showed', 'usually demonstrated', 'typically exhibited' \n- Instead of 'high performance': 'above-average performance', 'upper-tier performance', 'strong relative performance' \n- Instead of 'low values': 'below-median values', 'lower-quartile values', 'relatively modest values' \n- Use 'most', 'majority', 'primarily', 'largely' when patterns have exceptions \n- Use 'tends to', 'appears to', 'generally shows', 'commonly exhibits' for qualified observations \n- For time series with near-perfect patterns: 'maintained top position in nearly all periods', 'achieved highest values throughout most timeframes' \n- TEMPORAL QUALIFICATION EXAMPLES: \n  * Instead of 'consistently led throughout the entire period': 'led in most periods', 'dominated the majority of timeframes', 'held leadership for most of the visible period' \n  * Instead of 'consistently leading the market': 'frequently leading the market', 'typically holding market leadership', 'generally maintaining the top position' \n  * Instead of 'consistently outperforming all competitors': 'regularly outperforming most competitors', 'frequently achieving superior performance relative to competitors' \n  * Instead of 'never dropped below second': 'rarely fell below second place', 'typically maintained top-tier positioning' \n  * Instead of 'consistent upward trend': 'generally increasing trend with some fluctuations', 'predominantly upward movement' \n  * Instead of 'always outperformed competitors': 'regularly outperformed most competitors', 'frequently achieved superior performance' \n  * Instead of 'stable performance over time': 'relatively stable with occasional variations', 'maintained steady positioning in most periods' \n- REMEMBER: Even 95% consistency requires qualified language - absolute terms are reserved for 100% perfect patterns only \n\nHUMAN-LIKE FLOW PRINCIPLES: \n- Write with natural sentence rhythm and variety \n- Use connecting words: 'while', 'whereas', 'although', 'particularly' \n- Vary sentence structure to avoid monotony \n- Sound like a knowledgeable analyst explaining to a colleague \n- Maintain conversational yet professional tone \n\nOBJECTIVITY PRINCIPLES: \n- Be factual and conservative in claims \n- Avoid superlatives and overstated language \n- NO words like 'comprehensive', 'extensive', 'dramatic', 'significant' \n- Use neutral descriptors: 'shows variation', 'differs across', 'changes over time' \n- Underpromise, overdeliver - let the data speak for itself \n- When in doubt about precision, use more qualified language rather than absolute claims \n\nRESPECTFUL, PEOPLE-FIRST LANGUAGE: \n- Always use respectful, people-first, non-judgmental language—especially for data about human life, health, work, income, education, safety, or communities \n- Never stereotype, dehumanize, moralize, blame, or shame any group or individual \n- Describe patterns without implying intent, cause, or value judgments about people or groups \n- Prefer neutral terms (e.g., 'people', 'participants', 'workers', 'residents') over labels that could stigmatize \n- Do not reference protected characteristics unless clearly presented in the data and necessary for understanding \n- Emphasize aggregate patterns and trends; avoid implying anything about specific individuals \n- Avoid sensational or alarming phrasing; keep tone calm, considerate, and inclusive \n- If disparities appear, describe them factually without implying deficiency or fault \n\nPRIVACY AND SENSITIVITY: \n- Do not speculate about personal causes or motivations \n- Do not mention specific individuals or uniquely identifying details \n- Use careful framing for sensitive outcomes to prevent offense or harm \n\nDOMAIN-AWARE CONTEXTUALIZATION PRINCIPLES: \n- Leverage the 'dataset_summary' to understand what each field represents in the real world \n- Translate technical field names into domain-meaningful concepts for readers \n- Consider the business/research context when interpreting patterns \n- Connect observations to domain-specific implications (e.g., seasonal business cycles, customer behavior patterns, market dynamics) \n- Use domain-appropriate terminology while keeping language accessible \n- Explain why patterns matter in the context of the specific dataset domain \n- Reference the analytical 'goal' to ensure observations serve the intended purpose \n- Help readers understand not just what the data shows, but why it's significant in this domain \n\nCONTEXTUALIZATION EXAMPLES BY DOMAIN: \n- Sales data: 'Revenue patterns suggest seasonal buying behaviors typical in retail markets' \n- Healthcare data: 'Patient outcomes vary across treatment protocols in ways that align with clinical expectations' \n- Educational data: 'Student performance shows variations that correspond to known factors in academic achievement' \n- Financial data: 'Risk metrics demonstrate patterns consistent with market volatility principles' \n\nCONTENT APPROACH: \n- Describe visible trends and relationships between ALL fields with domain context \n- Note how each dimension interacts with others in ways meaningful to the dataset domain \n- Identify observable patterns across all visible variables and their domain significance \n- Create narrative flow connecting all elements within the analytical goal framework \n- Stay strictly to what's visually apparent while providing domain-relevant interpretation \n- Use dataset_summary to inform field interpretation and domain-appropriate language \n\nENHANCED CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS: \n- ALWAYS examine visualizations for non-obvious insights beyond first-glance patterns \n- Look for SECONDARY PATTERNS that might be easily missed: \n  * Subtle inflection points in trends \n  * Non-linear relationships between variables \n  * Clustering or grouping effects within categories \n  * Proportional relationships that reveal efficiency or productivity insights \n  * Variance patterns that indicate stability or volatility differences \n\n- CONTEXTUAL STORYTELLING OPPORTUNITIES: \n  * Connect patterns to likely business or domain explanations \n  * Note seasonal, cyclical, or structural factors that might explain patterns \n  * Identify performance tiers, segments, or natural groupings \n  * Discuss scale effects, maturity relationships, or competitive dynamics \n  * Comment on data quality indicators that affect interpretation confidence \n\n- MAXIMIZE VALUE EXTRACTION from each visualization: \n  * Don't just describe what's visible - explain what it might mean \n  * Identify the most interesting or counter-intuitive findings \n  * Note patterns that could inform strategic decisions or operational improvements \n  * Comment on outliers or anomalies that merit further investigation \n  * Discuss implications for stakeholders in the relevant domain \n\n- COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN ANALYSIS: \n  * Distribution characteristics: concentration, spread, skewness, multimodality \n  * Relationship patterns: correlation strength, linearity, interaction effects \n  * Temporal dynamics: trend directions, volatility, cyclical patterns, structural breaks \n  * Categorical differences: between-group variations, within-group consistency \n  * Hierarchical insights: how patterns change across different aggregation levels \n\nFIELD MARKUP: \n- Mark human-readable field labels: <span class=\"data-field\">Field Label</span> \n- Apply ONLY to the FIRST mention of each field - avoid repetitive span markup \n- After introducing a field with span markup, refer to it naturally without spans \n- EVERY field visible must be mentioned, but only wrapped in spans on first reference \n- NO technical notation (variable_names, snake_case, CamelCase) \n\nDATA VALUE MARKUP: \n- Mark explicit data values: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"SourceField\">Actual Value</span> \n- ALWAYS include data-field attribute pointing to the source field \n- Use human-readable field names in data-field attribute \n- NEVER add quotes or other glyphs around data values \n- Apply to specific categories, time periods, product names, etc. \n\nMARKUP EXAMPLES: \n- Field reference: <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> \n- Category value: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> \n- Time period: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q3 2024</span> \n- Product name: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> \n\nGOOD EXAMPLES (Direct observation style with domain contextualization and boolean precision): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Revenue</span> varies across different <span class=\"data-field\">Region</span>s, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern Region</span> frequently showing above-average performance while customer acquisition demonstrates seasonal fluctuations most notably in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Time Period\">Q4</span>, aligning with typical retail holiday patterns.' \n'Among the top-performing <span class=\"data-field\">Product Category</span> segments, <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Category\">Electronics</span> tends to achieve the strongest <span class=\"data-field\">Sales Performance</span>, while even the lowest-ranked category in this subset maintains substantial market presence, suggesting a healthy product portfolio diversification.' \n'Within the <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Customer Segment\">Enterprise</span> segment, <span class=\"data-field\">Monthly Revenue</span> from <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product Line\">Premium Series</span> shows predominantly upward movement throughout most of the analysis period, indicating successful market penetration in high-value accounts.' \n'<span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Company\">Acme Corp</span> led <span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> rankings (x-position) in most quarters but experienced a notable decline to third place in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2023</span>, while maintaining consistently strong <span class=\"data-field\">Profit Margins</span> (color intensity) throughout all periods.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Performance Metric</span> reveals an interesting leadership shift: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product A</span> dominated early periods but yielded first position to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Product B</span> following a significant dip in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2022</span>.' \n\nENHANCED EXAMPLES (Demonstrating semantic details and deeper insights): \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Customer Acquisition</span> patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4</span> consistently driving peak performance, though data gaps in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2021</span> limit trend confidence during that period.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Share</span> concentration shows the top three <span class=\"data-field\">Competitors</span> controlling substantial territory, while the analysis focuses on entities exceeding $10M revenue, potentially excluding emerging players below this threshold.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Growth Rates</span> demonstrate clear maturity effects: newer <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">startups</span> exhibit higher volatility compared to established <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Business Age\">10+ year</span> entities, suggesting different risk-return profiles across business lifecycles.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Regional Performance</span> varies significantly, with <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Western territories</span> showing limited data density compared to <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Region\">Eastern markets</span>, making western trend assessments more preliminary.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Efficiency Metrics</span> reveal an interesting threshold effect: performance improvement accelerates notably above the 15% <span class=\"data-field\">Market Penetration</span> level, suggesting scale advantages emerge at that inflection point.' \n\nTEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE EXAMPLES: \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Product Categories</span> show interesting lifecycle patterns: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Digital Services</span> emerges as a new offering beginning in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q2 2022</span>, while <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Product\">Legacy Hardware</span> disappears from the analysis after <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Quarter\">Q4 2021</span>, suggesting portfolio modernization.' \n'The <span class=\"data-field\">Revenue Streams</span> analysis reveals strategic shifts: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">Subscription Model</span> first appears mid-timeline in <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Year\">2023</span> and quickly gains traction, while traditional <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Revenue Type\">One-time Sales</span> show declining values throughout all visible periods but maintain continuous presence.' \n'<span class=\"data-field\">Market Segments</span> demonstrate different temporal dynamics: <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Premium Tier</span> emerges in the dataset starting <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Month\">March 2022</span>, indicating market expansion, whereas <span class=\"data-value\" data-field=\"Segment\">Enterprise</span> maintains steady presence with fluctuating <span class=\"data-field\">Performance</span> levels.' \n\nAVOID: \n- Chart/visualization references ('The chart shows...', 'The graph displays...') \n- Specific numbers or percentages \n- Overstated claims or superlatives without qualification \n- Technical field names \n- Absolute statements that have exceptions ('always', 'never', 'consistently' when not 100% true) \n- Unqualified claims about relative position ('high' when actually mid-range) \n- Trivial observations that add no insight value \n- Obvious ranking statements ('top performers perform well', 'lowest in top-10 still strong') \n- Self-evident filtering context ('these top items show good results') \n- Unfair comparisons between groups with vastly different sample sizes without acknowledgment \n- Drawing strong conclusions from small samples without appropriate caveats \n- Robotic or repetitive phrasing \n- Missing any visible fields in the description \n- Untagged data values (always use data-value spans for explicit values) \n- Quotes or glyphs around data values \n- Repetitive span markup (only wrap field names on first mention) \n- TEMPORAL RANKING PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Consistently led throughout the entire period' (requires 100% verification across all time points) \n  * 'Consistently leading the market' (implies leadership in ALL time periods without exception) \n  * 'Consistently outperforming competitors' (absolute claim requiring verification across every time point) \n  * 'Consistently ranked first' (implies first place in ALL visible periods) \n  * 'Consistently maintained top position' (suggests unbroken leadership across entire timeframe) \n  * 'Always maintained top position' (absolute claim without acknowledging any dips or exceptions) \n  * 'Performance remained stable over time' (ignores interesting temporal disruptions and patterns) \n  * 'Never fell below second place' (absolute negative claim requiring complete verification) \n  * 'Continuous upward trend' (ignores any downward movements or fluctuations) \n  * 'Steady leadership throughout' (misses compelling stories about leadership changes or challenges) \n  * 'Uniform performance across all periods' (overlooks interesting temporal variations and anomalies) \n  * Generic statements that miss the most compelling temporal narrative (dips, recoveries, leadership shifts) \n  * REMEMBER: 'Consistently' + any performance claim = absolute assertion requiring 100% temporal verification \n\n- TEMPORAL EMERGENCE/DISAPPEARANCE PITFALLS TO AVOID: \n  * 'Revenue increased from zero in Q3' when describing category emergence (should be 'Category emerges in Q3 as new business segment') \n  * 'Performance decreased to zero after March' when describing category disappearance (should be 'Category disappears after March, suggesting discontinuation') \n  * 'Category X went from 0 to significant levels' (should be 'Category X emerges mid-timeline and quickly establishes presence') \n  * Treating emergence as casual increase and disappearance as casual decrease \n  * Missing the strategic/business implications of categories entering or exiting the analysis scope \n  * Confusing data visualization artifacts with actual business phenomena \n  * Not distinguishing between 'not yet launched' and 'declining performance' \n  * Not distinguishing between 'discontinued/exited' and 'temporary poor performance'\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## goal ## ]]\n{goal}\n\n[[ ## section_title ##
